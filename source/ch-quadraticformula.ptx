        <p>  We begin with an exploration of a basic concept familiar to 
        most students, the quadratic formula. We will eventually get to 
        a derivation of this formula and proofs of its correctness. 
        However, it will
        take time to get there with comments and brief discussion of 
        some of the many conventions of writing mathematics found even 
        in this simple problem, as well as pointers the many other 
        mathematical directions and questions that can arise.  </p>
