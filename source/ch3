{\bf Examples of  $\delta-\epsilon$ proofs for  quadratics.}

{\sf Show, using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits,
that $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 3} x^2- x- 1=5$.}

Here is a proof of this. {\em Note that this final version cannot be
written down directly.  \\ Scratch work was needed first.} \\
There are also other ways to do this.

Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{1, \frac{\epsilon}{6}\}$. \\
If $0 < |x - 3| < \delta$ then
 $|x - 3| < 1 \Rightarrow -1 < x-3 < 1 \Rightarrow 4 < x+2 < 6$. \\
Therefore,  $|x+2| < 6$. \\
We also have,
$|x-3| < \frac{\epsilon}{6}$, so \\
 $|f(x) - L| =  |(x^2-x-1)-5| = |x^2-x-6| = |x+2||x-3| <
6 \cdot \frac{\epsilon}{6} = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that $ \lim_{x \to 3}x^2- x- 1=5$.

Some comments on  this proof:

\begin{itemize}

\item The choice of 1 in $\delta = \min\{1, \epsilon/6\}$ is
for convenient calculations. \\ Any positive number would also work.
If instead you pick $1/13$ or
$42$ or some other number \\ then other numbers in the proof  would change
but the same basic outline would work.

\item You must first start the computations on the fifth line,
 $|(x^2-x-1)-5| = \cdots$ \\ to get the second factor $|x + 2|$. \\
  The other factor will always be $x$ minus the value $a$ that $x$
 is approaching \\(if not you made an algebra mistake).

 \item Once you get $|x+2|$, this becomes the target in the second line,
 $|x - 3| < 1 \Rightarrow \cdots$.\\  You get two numbers at the
 end of this line, 4 and 6. \\ Use the larger absolute value (which could be either depending on signs)

  \item In this case the larger absolute value is 6   which is
  used \\ in the first, third, fourth
 and end of the fifth lines to complete the proof.
 \end{itemize}

Next is a template for seeing where the various parts to be fill
in. This is for quadratic functions. For other function that will follow the approach will be similar but
some of the algebra will be a bit different. In particular for square root functions and rational functions
we can't just pick  1 as part of the minimum. We must pick a number small enough to stay in the domain. That is, to avoid square root of a negative number or a 0 in the denominator. 

\newpage

A template for quadratic delta-epsilon proofs in which the coefficient on $x^2$ is 1. If this coefficient is not 1 there will a slight change in the $|x + \bigcirc|$ will have that coefficient on $x$. If the coefficient is negative we would need to be a little more careful in computing the bound $\Box$.

$\bigcirc$ represents the number you get from your first computation
at the start of the fifth line, a factorization of $f(x)-L$. \\
$\bigcirc$ is then used in the second line to get $\Diamond$ and
$\triangle$. \\
Determine the larger absolute value of $\Diamond$ or $\triangle$
and this becomes $\Box$ which now can be used in the first, third, fourth
and end of the fifth lines to complete the proof.


Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{1, \epsilon/\Box\}$. \\
If $0 < |x - 3| < \delta$ then
$|x - 3| < 1 \Rightarrow -1 < x-3 < 1 \Rightarrow \Diamond < x+\bigcirc < \triangle$ \\
Therefore $ |x+\bigcirc| < \Box$. \\
We also have,
$|x-3| < \epsilon/\Box$, so \\
$|f(x) - L| = |(x^2-x-1)-5| = |x^2-x-6| = |x+\bigcirc||x-3| <
\Box \cdot \frac{\epsilon}{\Box} = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 3}x^2- x- 1=5$.

In other examples you will need to replace the numbers/coefficients $-1,3,5,6$ that you see above with appropriate numbers from the particular problem and these will in turn determine what you get
for $\Box, \bigcirc, \triangle, \Diamond$.

 Here are two more examples.
 Again  {\em note that these final versions cannot be
written down directly. \\ Scratch work was needed first.}

%  Prove using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits
% that $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 2} x^2- 8x + 13 = 1$.


{\sf Show, using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits,
	that ${ \lim_{x \to 2} 3x^2 - 14x+ 5= -11}$.}

Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{1, \frac{\epsilon}{5} \}$. \\
If $0 < |x - 2| < \delta$ then
 $|x - 2| < 1 \Rightarrow -1 < x-2 < 1 \Rightarrow 1 < x < 3 \Rightarrow 
 -5 < 3x - 8 < 1$. \\
Therefore,  $|3x + 16| < 5$. \\
We also have,
$|x-2| < \frac{\epsilon}{5}$, so \\
 $|f(x) - L| = |(3x^2-14x+5)-(-11)| = |3x^2-14x+16| = |3x - 8| |x-2| <
5 \cdot \frac{\epsilon}{5} = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that ${ \lim_{x \to 2} 3x^2 - 14x+ 5= -11}$.


and

{\sf Show, using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits,
	that ${ \lim_{x \to -3} x^2 + 6x - 2 = -11}$.}

Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{1, \epsilon\}$. \\
If $0 < |x - (-3)| < \delta$ then
 $|x  + 3| < 1$ and $| x + 3| < \epsilon$. So \\
 $|f(x) - L| = |(x^2+ 6x - 2)-(-11)| = |x^2+ 6x  + 9| = |x + 3||x+3| <
1 \cdot \epsilon = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that ${ \lim_{x \to -3} x^2 + 6x - 2 = -11}$.


A comment on the second example:

\begin{itemize}
	\item In the second example both factors in the second to last line are the same. We treated each differently in terms of a bound to follow the patterns of the other quadratic proofs. It would also work to take $\delta = \sqrt{\epsilon}$ here.

{\bf Examples of  $\delta-\epsilon$ proofs for certain square root functions.}

Prove using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits
that ${\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 5} \sqrt{8x + 9} =7}$.

Here is a proof of this. {\em Note that this final version cannot be
written down directly. \\ Scratch work was needed first.} \\
There are also other ways to do this.

Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{1, \frac{7}{8} \epsilon \}$. \\
If $0 < |x -5| < \delta$ then
 $|x - 5| < 1 \Rightarrow -1 < x-5 < 1 \Rightarrow 4 < x < 6
 \Rightarrow 41 < 8x + 9 < 57$. \\
Therefore,  $(8x+9) >  0$, so $\sqrt{8x+9}$ is defined and
$\sqrt{8x+9} > 0$. \\
Thus $\frac{8}{\sqrt{8x+9} + 7} < \frac {8}{7}$. \\
We also have,
$|x-5| < \frac{7}{8} \epsilon$, so \\
 $|f(x) - L| = | \sqrt{8x+9} - 7| = |(\sqrt{8x+9} - 7) \cdot
 \frac{\sqrt{8x+9} + 7}{\sqrt{8x+9} + 7}| =
 |\frac{(8x+9)- 49}{\sqrt{8x+9} + 7}| = |\frac{8x-40}{\sqrt{8x+9} + 7}|=
 \frac{8}{\sqrt{8x+9} + 7} \cdot |x-5| < \frac {8}{7}
 \cdot \frac{7}{8} \epsilon = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that ${\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 5} \sqrt{8x + 9} =7}$.

Some comments on this proof:

\begin{itemize}

\item You cannot always use a 1 in $\delta = \min\{1, \frac{7}{8} \epsilon \}$.
You need to pick a small enough number so that whatever is under the square root
stays positive for the possible $x$ values.

\item If the coefficient on $x$ under the square root is negative then you will need its
absolute value in the fourth line.

 \end{itemize}

 % Here is another example where you cannot use 1 in the $\min$ in the first line.

{\sf Show, using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits,
	that ${\lim_{x \to 4} \sqrt{3x - 10} =\sqrt{2}}$.}

Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{\frac{1}{6}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \epsilon \}$. \\
If $0 < |x -4| < \delta$ then
 $|x - 4| < \frac{1}{6} \Rightarrow -\frac{1}{6} < x-4 < \frac{1}{6} \Rightarrow
  \frac{23}{6} < x < \frac{25}{6}
 \Rightarrow  \frac{3}{2} < 3x-10 < \frac{5}{2}$. \\
Therefore,  $(3x-10) >  0$, so $\sqrt{3x-10}$ is defined and
$\sqrt{3x-10} > 0$. \\
Thus $\frac{3}{\sqrt{3x- 10} + \sqrt{2}} < \frac {3}{\sqrt{2}}$. \\
We also have,
$|x-4| < \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \epsilon$, so \\
 $|f(x) - L| = | \sqrt{3x-10} - \sqrt{2}| = |(\sqrt{3x-10} - \sqrt{2}) \cdot
 \frac{\sqrt{3x-10} + \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3x-10} + \sqrt{2}}| =
 |\frac{(3x-10)- 2}{\sqrt{3x-10} + \sqrt{2}}| = |\frac{3x-12}{\sqrt{3x-10} + \sqrt{2}}|$ \\ $=
 \frac{3}{\sqrt{3x-10} + \sqrt{2}} \cdot |x-4| < \frac {3}{\sqrt{2}}
 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \epsilon = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that ${\lim_{x \to 4} \sqrt{3x - 10} =\sqrt{2}}$.

and 


{\sf Show, using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits,
	that ${\lim_{x \to 2} \sqrt{-4x + 15} =\sqrt{7}}$.}


Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{1, \frac{\sqrt{7}}{4} \epsilon \}$. \\
If $0 < |x -2| < \delta$ then
 $|x - 2| < 1 \Rightarrow -1 < x-2 < 1 \Rightarrow
  1 < x < 3
 \Rightarrow  11 > -4x + 15 >  3$. \\
Therefore,  $(-4x+15) >  0$, so $\sqrt{-4x+ 15}$ is defined and
$\sqrt{-4x+15} > 0$. \\
Thus $\frac{4}{\sqrt{-4x+ 15} + \sqrt{7}} < \frac {4}{\sqrt{7}}$. \\
We also have,
$|x-2| < \frac{\sqrt{7}}{4} \epsilon$, so \\
 $|f(x) - L| = | \sqrt{-4x+15} - \sqrt{7}| = |(\sqrt{-4x+15} - \sqrt{7}) \cdot
 \frac{\sqrt{-4x+15} + \sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{-4x+15} + \sqrt{7}}| =
 |\frac{(-4x+15)- 7}{\sqrt{-4x+15} + \sqrt{7}}| = |\frac{-4x+8}{\sqrt{-4x+15} + \sqrt{7}}|$ \\ $=
 \frac{4}{\sqrt{-4x+15} + \sqrt{7}} \cdot |x-2| < \frac {4}{\sqrt{7}}
 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{7}}{4} \epsilon = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that ${\lim_{x \to 2} \sqrt{-4x + 15} =\sqrt{7}}$.



{\bf Examples of  $\delta-\epsilon$ proofs for certain rational functions.}

Prove using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits
that ${\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 3} \frac{21}{x} + 2 =9 }$.

Here is a proof of this. {\em Note that this final version cannot be
written down directly. \\ Scratch work was needed first.} \\
There are also other ways to do this.

Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{1, \frac{2}{7} \epsilon \}$. \\
If $0 < |x - 3| < \delta$ then
 $|x - 3| < 1 \Rightarrow -1 < x-3 < 1 \Rightarrow 2 < x < 4$. \\
Therefore,  $\frac{1}{|x|} < \frac{1}{2}$. \\
We also have,
$|x-3| < \frac{2}{7} \epsilon $, so \\
 $|f(x) - L| =  |(\frac{21}{x} + 2) - 9| = |\frac{21}{x} - 7| = |\frac{21-7x}{x}| =
 7 \cdot \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot |x - 3| <
7 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot  \frac{2}{7} \epsilon  = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that $\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{21}{x} + 2 =9$.

\begin{itemize}

\item You cannot always use a 1 in $\delta = \min\{1, \frac{2}{7} \epsilon \}$.
You need to pick a small enough number so that $x$ cannot be 0 (as division
by 0 is impossible).

\item In the third line we could have concluded further that $\frac {1}{|x|} < 1$ and
eliminated the 2 in $\frac{2}{7} \epsilon$. However leaving it illustrates more generally
what is done.

 \end{itemize}

 Here are two more examples.
 Again  {\em note that these final versions cannot be
written down directly. \\ Scratch work was needed first.}

{\sf Show, using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits,
	that $\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{4 + 2x}{x} =6$.}

Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{8} \epsilon \}$. \\
If $0 < |x - 1| < \delta$ then
 $|x - 1| < \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow -\frac{1}{2} < x-1 < \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} < x < \frac{3}{2}$. \\
Therefore,  $\frac{1}{|x|} < \frac{1}{1/2} = 2$. \\
We also have,
$|x-1| < \frac{1}{8} \epsilon $, so \\
 $|f(x) - L| =  |(\frac{4+ 2x}{x} ) - 6| =  |\frac{4-4x}{x}| =
 4 \cdot \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot |x - 1| <
4 \cdot 2 \cdot  \frac{1}{8} \epsilon  = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that $\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{4}{x} + 2 =6$.

and

{\sf Show, using the $\delta, \epsilon$ definition of limits,
	that $\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{2x}{3x -4} =2$.}

Given $\epsilon > 0$ let $\delta = \min\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\epsilon}{8}  \}$. \\
If $0 < |x - 2| < \delta$ then
$|x - 2| < \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow -\frac{1}{2} < x-2 < \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow \frac{3}{2} < x < \frac{5}{2}
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} < 3x-4 < \frac{7}{2}$.
 \\
Therefore,  $\frac{1}{|3x-4|} < \frac{1}{1/2} = 2$. \\
We also have,
$|x-2| = < \frac{\epsilon}{8} $, so \\
 $|f(x) - L| =  |\frac{2x}{3x-4}  - 2| = |\frac{2x - 2(3x-4)}{3x-4}| = |\frac{-4x + 8}{3x-4}| =
 |-4| \cdot \frac{1}{|3x-4|} \cdot |x  - 2| <
4 \cdot 2 \cdot  \frac{\epsilon}{8}   = \epsilon$. \\
This shows that $\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{2x}{3x -4} =2$.
