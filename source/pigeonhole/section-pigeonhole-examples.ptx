  <title>Examples using the Pigeonhole Principle</title>

 <p>
  
Returning to the pigeonhole principle we illustrate its use 
with several examples. 

 </p> 

<p> Recall that we can use long division to represent a rational number 
  as a decimal, either as a terminating decimal or a reapeating decimal.

For example <m> \frac{3}{24} = \frac{1}{8} = .125</m>  is a 
 terminating decimal and
<m> \frac{3}{7} = .4285742857\ldots =  \overline{.42857} </m> repeats 
where the line over the <m> 42857</m>  indicate a pattern that 
repeats infinitely often. 
</p> 

<p>

Consider the long division


The key idea is that either a reminder of 0 is reached, 
in which case the expansion terminates or some remainder repeats, 
after which the pattern repeats. We must terminate or have a repeat
because the possible reminders are all strictly less than the denominator. 
So if the denominator is <m> b</m> , the possible remainders are 
<m> 0,1,2, \ldots, b-1</m> . If a remainder of 0 occurs by <m> b^{th}</m>  
division the expansion terminates with at most <m> b-1</m>  decimals. 
If no 0 occurs by the <m> b^{th}</m>  division, by the pigeonhole principle
 there must be a repeat as 
there are only <m> b-1</m>  nonzero remainders. So, if the division
does not terminate, the pattern repeats with at most <m> b-1</m>  terms.

</p> 

<p>
While we haven't formally written out a full proof this gives an 
 outline of a proof of the following based on the pigeonhole principle.
</p> 

 <fact xml:id="fact-longdiv">
  <statement>
    <p>
      The decimal expansion of any rational number either 
      terminates or repeats. </p> 
	
	<p> Moreover, 
  if the expansion repeats and the reduced form 
  (no common factor in numerator and denominator) 
  of the fraction is <m> \frac{a}{b} </m>  the pattern that repeats has 
  length at most <m> b-1</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</fact>

 

<exploration xml:id="expl-pigeon-div">
   Pick any 6 numbers from <m> \{1,2,3, \ldots, 10\}</m>  
  and show that at least one divides another. 
  <solution>
    <p>
      
      We could approach this as follows: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If 1 is selected we are done. It divides any other number
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If 2 is selected then no other even 
            number can be selected and only 4 odd numbers remain
          </p>
        </li> 
         <li>  <p>
            If 3 is selected then we can't pick 6 or 9 so all remaining 
            numbers, including 4 and 8 must be selected
          </p>
        </li> 
         <li>  <p>
            etc.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      

      This sort of reasoning will work for this small example. 
      However, it would become very long and complicated for a larger 
      example, say showing that picking 51 numbers 
      from <m> 1,2,3, \ldots, 100</m>  will again yield a pair where 
      one divides the other.

    </p> 

    <p>
      We need another strategy, especially if we hope this to extend 
      to prove a general result, picking from <m> 1,2,,3, \ldots, 2n</m> for any 
      <m>n</m>.
    </p>
  
    
    <p> Picking from <m> \{1,2,3, \ldots, 10\}</m> and avoiding one number 
      dividing another
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            we can pick at most one of <m> \{1,2,4,8\}</m>.
    What remains is <m> 3,5,6,7,9,10</m> 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            we can pick at most one of <m> \{3,6\}</m> and at most one of <m> \{5,10\}</m> 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Trivially we can pick at most 
            one of <m> \{7\}</m>  and one of <m> \{9\}</m> 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
    We have partitioned <m> \{1,2, \ldots, 10\}</m>  into 5 sets 
    (pigeonholes) with the property that if two numbers are selected 
    from any part, one divides another. 
    
    By the pigeonhole principle, if we pick <em>any </em> 6 numbers, 
    2 must be picked from some set. So we get our result
    
    </p>
  </solution>
</exploration>

<p>
  Extending the ideas from <xref ref="expl-pigeon-div"/> 
  to larger numbers we get that we can pick at most one number from any of the following
  if we want to avoid a number dividing another.
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <m> \{1,2,4,8,16,32, \ldots \}</m>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <m> \{3,6,12,24,48,  \ldots \}</m> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <m> \{5,10,20,40, \ldots \}</m> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <m> \{7,14,28,56, \ldots \}</m> 
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>  

For each set we pick an odd number and keep doubling. Note that

<ol>
  <li> Each positive integer will appear in some list 
    as any positive integer can be written as <m> 2^km</m>  for some <m> k</m>  and some odd number <m> m</m>. </li>
    
    <li> In each set  if we pick any pair, the smaller divides the larger.  </li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
  To build toward a pigeonhole proof of a general result note the context. 
  We are picking <em> any </em> subset of a given size from some larger set. 
  We want to partition the larger set first and use this partition to 
  define a partition of the smaller selected set. The partition of the 
  larger set should have an appropriate property. 
  In this example picking any pair, yield the desired divisibility.
</p>

<p> We can think of this as assigning pigeonholes for which each pigeon 
  that might show up will go. If enough pigeons show up then some 
  pigeonhole is guaranteed to have at least 2 pigeons. </p>

<p> We can now use these ideas for a general result. </p> 

<p> In the following we will make use of the fact that each positive 
  integer has a unique prime factorization and hence can be 
  written uniquely as <m> 2^km</m>  for an odd integer <m> m</m>. 
  Uniqueness is not necessary for our proof but we may as well note it.
</p> 

<proposition xml:id="prop-pigeon-divt">
  <statement>
    <p>
      If  <m> n+1</m>  distinct integers are selected from 
      <m> [2n] = \{1,2, \ldots, 2n \}</m>  
      then at least one of the selected numbers divides another.   
    </p>
    <p>
      The bound <m> n+1</m>  is best possible. 
    </p>
  </statement>
</proposition>

<p> Note that we have in addition stated that the result is 
  <term> best possible </term>.
  By this we mean that we cannot reduce the <m>n+1</m> in the statement 
  to <m>n</m>. We <em>can </em>  pick a subset of <m>[2n] </m> with size <m>n</m>
  for which no number divdes another. 
</p>

<proof> <p>
  Given <m>n+1</m> integers from <m>[2n]</m> partition them into
  <m>n</m> parts
  <m> P_1,P_3, \ldots, P_{2n-1}</m>  with <m> i \in P_m</m> 
  if <m> i = 2^km</m>. That is, place each integer into the part indexed by
  its largest odd divisor. This divisor is at most <m>2n-1</m> so each interger is
  placed in one of the <m>P_m</m>.  Since there are <m> n</m>  parts  and <m> n+1</m>  integers, 
 some part has size at least 2 by the pigeonhole principle. 
</p> 

  <p> Since any two integers in <m> P_m</m> 
are of the form <m> 2^{k_1}m</m>  and <m> 2^{k_2}m</m>, one divides 
the other. </p> 

<p>
  To show that the bound is best possible consider the set of <m>n</m> numbers
  <m>\{ n+1, n+2 \ldots, 2n \} \subseteq [2n]</m>. 
  None divides another as twice any of the numbers is greater than <m>2n</m>.
 <m> \Box</m> 
</p>

</proof> 


	<remark>
  <p> 
	Observe that the two previous examples made use of the pigeonhole 
  principle in slightly different ways. </p> 

  <p>  For the example on decimals, the pigeonholes were trivial to describe 
   and having 2 in a box meant that we couldn't continue division 
   infinitely without repeating. </p> 
   
   <p> 
    For the division example, it took some work to discover 
    appropriate pigeonholes so that any 2 in a box would have 
    the desired property. 
   </p> 

</remark>

<p> We conclude with one more example that covers a special case of the Remainder
Theorem that we will examine later in <xref provisional="ch-remainder"/>.
</p> 

<example xml:id ="expl-remainder1">
  <p>
  If <m>x</m> is a number between 1 and 20 that leaves a remainder
  of 2 when divided by 5 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 what is it?
  </p>
  
  <p>
  This is small enough that we could check it by trial and error. However,
  one question we might ask is if the number is unique. We might also ask
  if there such a number is guarenteed to exist for any choice of remainders.
  In each case the answer is yes. Indeed this will be true for any pair of numbers
  that we divide by, replacing 5 and 4, as long as the numbers are <term> relatively prime </term>. 
  That is, as long as they share no common divisor.  
  </p>
  <solution>
  <p>
  As noted, this problem is small enough that we could find the answer by trial an error.
  However, we will follow a more systematic approach that will lead to 
  a proof in the more general setting.
  </p>
  
  <p> Consider the 4 numbers <m>2, 2+5, 2+10, 2+15</m> that leave a remainder
  of 2 when divided by 5.  One of them, <m>2 + 15 = 17</m>, <q>works</q>
  leaving a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.  
  </p>
  
  <p> Note that here we listed 4 numbers with the right remainder when 
  divided by 4. Could it have been the case that none of them
  had a remainder of 1 when divided by 4? If not, then since there
  are 3 other possible remainders, by the pigeonhole principle, some pair would have the same remainder.
  This possibly will lead us to a contradiction so that we will be able to conslude
  that we will always find a solution.
  </p> 
  </solution>
  </example>

<p> Recalling notation from <xref ref="ch-quadratic-formula" />  
we write <m>x \equiv a \pmod{n}</m> and say that <m>x</m> is congruent to
  <m>a</m> modulo <m>n</m> if <m>x</m> and <m>a</m> leave the same remainder when
  divided by <m>n</m>.
</p> 

<p>
  We will say that two numbers are <term>relatively prime</term> if their greatest
  common divisor is 1. That is, the primes in thier prime factorizations 
  are different. 
</p>

<p>
  We can now state a general version of <xref ref="expl-remainder1" />.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="prop-remainder2">
      <title>Remainder Theorem, <m>n=2</m> case</title>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> be relaively prime natural numbers. For any 
      <m>a,b </m> with  <m>0 \leq a \lt m</m> and <m>0 \leq b \lt n</m>
      there exists a unique integer <m>x</m> with <m>0 \leq x \lt mn</m>
      such that <m>x \equiv a \pmod{m}</m> and <m>x \equiv b \pmod{n}</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</proposition>

<p> That is, if <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>   have greatest common divisor 1
and we pick any pair of remainders <m>a,b </m> from division by <m>m</m>
and <m>n</m> repspectively there is a unique number less that <m>mn </m>
that has these remainders. 
</p> 

<p> We will not prove uniqueness here. </p> 
<p> In the proof we will use the fact, which can be easily checked
  that if <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are relatively prime (share no divisors other than 1)
  then their least common mulitple is <m>mn</m>. 
</p>

<proof>
  <p>
    Consider the <m>n</m> numbers <m>z_i = a + im</m>   for <m>i = 0,1, \ldots, n-1</m>. 
    That is, the numbers <m>a, a+m, a+2m, \ldots, a + (n-1)m</m>. Note that each
     <m>z_i \equiv a \pmod{m} </m> and hence each <m>z_j - z_i</m> is a multiple of <m>m</m>.
      If any <m>z_i</m> is also congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>n</m>,
     it has the needed property and
     we are done. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Assume that no <m>z_i</m> is congruent to <m>b</m> modulo <m>n</m> and reach a contradiction. 
    This will show that some <m>z_i</m> must have this property. </p>  
    
    <p> Partition the <m>z_i</m> based on the remainder 
    modulo <m>n</m>. Since we are assuming the remainder is not <m>b</m>, it is one of the
    remaining <m>n-1</m> values, other than <m>b</m> from <m>0,1, \ldots, n-1</m>. By the pigeonhole principle
    there must be two values with the same remainder. So we can assume
    <m> z_i \equiv z_j \equiv r \pmod{n}</m> for some <m>r</m> and some <m>(n-1) \geq j \gt i \geq 0</m>. 
    Thus <m>y = z_j - z_i</m> is a mulitple of <m>n</m>.  
    Also as noted above, <m>y</m> is also multiple of <m>m</m>. Since <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are relatively prime, their least common multiple 
    is <m>mn</m>. Hence <m>y</m> is a multiple of <m>mn</m>. This is a contradiction since <m>y = (j-i)m</m> with
    <m>0 \lt j-i \leq n-1</m>. <m>\Box</m>
  </p>

  

</proof>


<p>
  In <xref ref="ch-monotone"/> we will look 
    at monotone sequences and one of the results will 
    follow from an application of 
    the pigeonhole principle. In <xref ref="sec-induction-ramsey"/>
    we will explore Ramsey Theory which can be viewed as a generalization
    of the pigeonhole principle.
