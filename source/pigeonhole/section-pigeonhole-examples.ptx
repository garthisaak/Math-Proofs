  <title>Examples using the Pigeonhole Principle</title>

 <p>
  
Returning to the pigeonhole principle we illustrate with several examples. 

 </p> 

<p> Recall that we can use long division to represent a rational number 
  as a decimal, either as a terminating decimal or a reapeating decimal..

For example <m> \frac{3}{24} = \frac{1}{8} = .125</m>  is a 
 terminating decimal and
<m> \frac{3}{7} = .4285742857\ldots =  \overline{.42857} </m> repeats 
where the line over the <m> 42857</m>  indicate a pattern that 
repeats infinitely often. 
</p> 

<p>

Consider the long division

<figure width="70%" xml:id="fig-longdiv">
  <image source="longdiv.pdf"/>
</figure>

<me>  \require{enclose}    7 \enclose{longdiv}{3.000000} 
 
 </me>

The key idea is that either a reminder of 0 is reached, 
in which case the expansion terminates or some remainder repeats, 
after which the pattern repeats. We guarantee that there is a repeat 
because the reminders are strictly less than the denominator. 
So if the denominator is <m> b</m> , the possible remainders are 
<m> 0,1,2, \ldots, b-1</m> . If a remainder of 0 occurs by <m> b^{th}</m>  
division the expansion terminates with at most <m> b-1</m>  decimals. 
If no 0 occurs by the <m> b^{th}</m>  division, by the pigeonhole principle
 there must be a repeat as 
there are only <m> b-1</m>  nonzero remainders. So, if the division
does not terminate, the pattern repeats with at most <m> b-1</m>  terms.

</p> 

<p>
While we haven't formally written out a full proof this gives an 
 outline of a proof of the following based on the pigeonhole principle.
</p> 

 <proposition xml:id="prop-longdiv">
  <statement>
    <p>
      The decimal expansion of any rational number either 
      terminates or repeats. </p> 
	
	<p> Moreover, 
  if the expansion repeats and the reduced form 
  (no common factor in numerator and denominator) 
  of the fraction is <m> \frac{a}{b} </m>  the pattern that repeats has 
  length at most <m> b-1</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
 </proposition>

 

<exploration xml:id="expl-pigeon-div">
  Pick any 6 numbers from <m> \{1,2,3, \ldots, 10\}</m>  
  and show that at least one divides another.
  <solution>
    <p>
      
      We could approach this as follows: 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If 1 is selected we are done. It divides any other number
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If 2 is selected then no other even 
            number can be selected and only 4 odd numbers remain
          </p>
        </li> 
         <li>  <p>
            If 3 is selected then we can't pick 6 or 9 so all remaining 
            numbers, including 4 and 8 must be selected
          </p>
        </li> 
         <li>  <p>
            etc.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      

      This sort of reasoning will work for this small example. 
      However, it would become very long and complicated for a larger 
      example, say showing that picking 51 numbers 
      from <m> 1,2,3, \ldots, 100</m>  will again yield a pair where 
      one divides the other.

    </p> 

    <p>
      We need another strategy, especially if we hope this to extend 
      to a general result, picking from <m> 1,2,,3, \ldots, 2n</m>.
    </p>
  
    
    <p> Picking from <m> \{1,2,3, \ldots, 10\}</m> and avoiding one number 
      dividing another
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            we can pick at most one of <m> \{1,2,4,8\}</m>.
    What remains is <m> 3,5,6,7,9,10</m> 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            we can pick at most one of <m> \{3,6\}</m> and at most one of <m> \{5,10\}</m> 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Trivially we can pick at most 
            one of <m> \{7\}</m>  and one of <m> \{9\}</m> 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
    We have partitioned <m> \{1,2, \ldots, 10\}</m>  into 5 sets 
    (pigeonholes) with the property that if two numbers are selected 
    from any part , one divides another. 
    
    By the pigeonhole principle, if we pick <em>any </em> 6 numbers, 
    2 must be picked from some set. So we get our result
    
    </p>
  </solution>
</exploration>

<p>
  Extending the ideas from <xref ref="expl-pigeon-div"/> 
  to larger numbers we get that we can pick at most one number from any of the following
  if we want to avoid a number dividing another.
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <m> \{1,2,4,8,16,32, \ldots \}</m>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <m> \{3,6,12,24,48,  \ldots \}</m> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <m> \{5,10,20,40, \ldots \}</m> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <m> \{7,14,28,56, \ldots \}</m> 
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>  

For each set we pick an odd number and keep doubling. Note that

<ol>
  <li> Each positive integer will appear in some list 
    as any positive integer can be written as <m> 2^km</m>  for some <m> k</m>  and some odd number <m> m</m>. </li>
    
    <li> In each set  if we pick any pair, the smaller divides the larger.  </li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
  To build toward a pigeonhole proof of a general result note the context. 
  We are picking {\em any} subset of a given size from some larger set. 
  We want to partition the larger set first and use this partition to 
  define a partition of the smaller selected set. The partition of the 
  larger set should have an appropriate property. 
  In this example picking any pair, yield the desired divisibility.
</p>

<p> We can think of this as assigning pigeonholes for which each pigeon 
  that might show up will go. If enough pigeons show up then some 
  pigeonhole is guaranteed to have at least 2 pigeons. </p>

<p> We can now use these ideas for a general result. </p> 

<p> In the following we will make use of the fact that each positive 
  integer has a unique prime factorization and hence can be 
  written uniquely as <m> 2^km</m>  for an odd integer <m> m</m>. 
  Uniqueness is not necessary for our proof but we may as well note it.
</p> 

<proposition xml:id="prop-pigeon-divt">
  <statement>
    <p>
      If  <m> n+1</m>  distinct integers are selected from 
      <m> [2n] = \{1,2, \ldots, 2n \}</m>  
      then at least one of the selected numbers divides another.   
    </p>
    <p>
      The bound <m> n+1</m>  is best possible. 
    </p>
  </statement>
</proposition>

<p> Note that we have in addition stated that the result is 
  <term> best possible </term>.
  By this we mean that we cannot reduce the <m>2n+1</m> in the statement 
  to <m>2n</m>. We can pick a subset of <m>[2n] </m> with size <m>n</m>
  for which no number divdes another. 
</p>

<proof> <p>
 Write each integer as <m> 2^km</m>  for some <m> k</m>  and odd integer 
 <m> m</m>. Note that <m> m \leq n-1</m>  for any integer 
 at most <m> 2n</m>.  Partition the integers <m> \{1,2, \ldots, 2n\}</m>  
into <m> P_1,P_3, \ldots, P_{2n-1}</m>  with <m> i \in P_m</m>  
if <m> i = 2^km</m>.  Since any two integers in <m> P_m</m> 
are of the form <m> 2^{k_1}m</m>  and <m> 2^{k_2}m</m>, one divides 
the other. </p> 

<p> Given any <m> n+1</m>  integers from <m> \{1,2,3, \ldots, 2n \}</m>, 
  partition them based on the partitions <m> P_i</m>  for <m> i</m>  odd. 
Since there are <m> n</m>  parts  and <m> n+1</m>  integers, 
some part has size at least 2 by the pigeonhole principle. 
Such a pair has the smaller dividing the larger. <m> \Box</m> 

</p>
</proof> 


	<remark>
  <p> 
	Observe that the two previous examples made use of the pigeonhole 
  principle in slightly different ways. </p> 

  <p>  For the example on decimals, the pigeonholes were trivial to describe 
   and having 2 in a box meant that we couldn't continue division 
   infinitely without repeating. </p> 
   
   <p> 
    For the division example, it took some work to discover 
    appropriate pigeonholes so that any 2 in a box would have 
    the desired property. 
   </p> 

</remark>

<p>
  In <xref provisional="ch-montone"/> we will look 
    at monotone sequences. One of the result will require a non trivial application of the pigeonhole principle.
