  <p> 
    Here is one 
    standard example of a proof by contradiction.
  </p> 
  
  <p>  The proof will assume an understanding of 
    prime numbers, positive integers greater than 1 with no 
    divisors other than 1 and the number itself and will also 
    assume the fact that that every non 
    prime is a product of primes.  
Also we assume the following which can easily be checked.

  </p>

<fact xml:id="fact-ababplus1">
  <statement>
    <p>
      If <m> a</m>  and <m> b</m>  are positive integers 
      then <m> a</m>  does not divide <m> ab+1</m>  except when <m> a = 1</m> 
    </p>
  </statement>
</fact>

<p> 
We also use additional notation. 
</p>


<definition xml:id="def-products">
  <statement>
    <p>
      We use the following to indicate a product of multiple numbers
	<me>   p_1p_2 \ldots p_k = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i </me> 
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>
	
<remark>
  This notation isn't necessary here. We could simply have used 
  $p_1p_2 \ldots p_k$. However it is useful to start to get used to the alternate notation for situations where the more compact form will make the display easier to read.
</remark>

<p> 
We can now give another example of a proof using contradiction. 
The result is attributed to Euclid who first published a proof over 
2000 years ago, although his original proof was slightly different.
</p>  

<theorem xml:id="thm-infprimes">
  <statement>
    <p>
      There are infinitely many primes. 
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

	<proof>
    <p>
      Assume that there are finitely many primes, 
      <m> p_1,p_2, \ldots, p_k</m>.
 Consider the number  <m> m = 1 + \prod_{i=1}^k p_i</m>. 
 If <m> m</m>  is not prime, it is a product of primes so <m> p_i</m>  
 divides <m> m</m>  for at least one of the primes <m> p_i</m>. However,  by
 <xref ref="fact-ababplus1"/>, <m> p_i</m>  does not divide <m> m</m>, 
 a contradiction. So there must be infintely many primes. <m> \Box</m> 
    </p> 
</proof>
 
 <p> Note that this proof does not imply that <m> 1 + \prod_{i=1}^k p_i</m>
    is a prime, as we are producing a counterexample. Implicit in the 
    proof is the fact that a number that is 1 more than a product of 
    primes has none of those
 primes as a factor. But it can have other prime factors. For example <m> 2 \cdot 3 + 1 = 7</m>  is prime, <m> 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 + 1= 31</m>  is prime, <m> \ldots</m>   <m> 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 + 1 = 2311</m> 
 is prime. But, 
 <m> 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 + 1 = 30031 = 
  59 \cdot 509</m>  is not prime but both of its prime factors are not
  on the list of primes we used <m>2,3,5,7,11,13</m>.
