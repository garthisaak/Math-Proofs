  <title>Pigeonhole Principle  Introduction </title>

 <p>  
<exploration>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A class has 15 students. </p>

        <p> Is it possible that everyone has their birthday in a different month?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        No, the are 15 people and 12  months. There must be a duplicate.
      </p>
    </solution>
</exploration>
</p> 

<p>
  This simple, intuitive idea is formalized in the 
  <idx><h>pigeonhole principle</h></idx> <term> pigeonhole principle </term>. 
</p>

<p>
The statement above clearly captures the idea of a proof but we 
will need to do a little more to make it a full proof and add some 
notation to capture the general idea, not just for numbers 
15 and 12 but any integers <m> m \gt n</m>.
</p>

<p>
Note that with 12 months and anywhere from 13 to 24 students 
we must have some month with at least 2 birthdays. More could happen. 
Its quite possible that there are several such instances, 
say two students  born in January and 2 others born in October, 
or even 3 or more all born in the same month. However, neither of these is 
guaranteed if there are 24 or fewer students. With 24 students 
each month could have 2 shared birthdays or one month could have 
all birthdays.   However with 25 or more students then some month 
must have 3 birthdays. We can extend this pattern to larger values. 
</p>

<p>
To state the pigeonhole principle we need notation for rounding up. 
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-ceilfloor">
  <statement>
    <p>
      The <term> ceiling function </term> <m>\lceil x \rceil</m>  rounds <m> x</m>  up the next integer. That is, <m> \lceil x \rceil</m> 
	is the smallest integer greater than or equal to <m> x</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
	The <term> floor function </term>  <m> \lfloor x \rfloor</m>  rounds <m> x</m>  down the next integer. That is,  <m> \lfloor x \rfloor</m> 
	is the largest integer less than or equal to <m> x</m>. 
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<theorem xml:id="thm-pigeonhole">
  <title>Pigeonhole Principle</title>
  
  
  <statement>
    <p>
      For positive integers <m> m > n</m>  if a set of size <m> m</m>  is partitioned into <m> n</m>  parts then some part has 
 	size at least <m> \lceil \frac{m}{n} \rceil</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<p>
  A special case stated in different terminology is: If more than <m>n</m> pigeons are placed 
  into <m>n</m> pigeonholes then some pigeonhole has at least 2 pigeons.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-pigeonhole-alt">
  <title>Pigeonhole Principle - alternate notation</title>
  
  
  <statement>
    <p>
      If a set of size at least <m> kn+1</m>  is partitioned into <m> n </m>  parts then some part has 
	size at least <m> k+1</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<p>
  It is a matter of style as to which version is preferred. The alternate notation will be 
  more convenient for our short proofs. 
</p>

<p>
  Note that the Pigeonhole Principle is called a <q>principle</q> rather than a theorem.
  Technically it is a theorem but as it is immediately clear it is frequently stated without proof.
  For our purposes in exploring proof writing, this provides a good opportunity 
  to explore styles of writing proofs as the underlying idea
  is <q>obvious</q>.
</p>


<p> We will give two slight variants on the same proof of the Pigeonhole 
Principle, one using a proof by <term> contradiction </term>  and one 
using the <term> contrapositive </term>. 
</p>

<p>
  We will the word contrapositive without defining it. The statements
  in <xref ref="thm-pigeonhole-alt"/>  and   <xref ref="thm-pigeonhole-contrapositive"/>
  are equivalent, either both are true or both or false. We will see this more
  formally soon but consider these examples and their proofs as an illustration
  of the more general results about the contrpositive. 
</p> 

<theorem xml:id="thm-pigeonhole-contrapositive">
  <title>Pigeonhole Principle Contrpositive </title>
  
  
  <statement>
    <p>
      If a set is partitioned into <m>n</m>
      parts, each with size at most <m>k</m>, then the set size is at most <m> kn</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
  <title>Proof of Pigeonhole Principle (alternate notation) by Contradiction</title>
  
  <p>
    Let  <m> s_i</m>  denote the size of the <m> i^{th}</m>  part. 
    So <m>s_1 + \cdots + s_n \geq kn+1</m>.
    Assume, for contradiction that all parts have size at most <m> k</m>. 
    That is, assume that <m> s_i \leq k</m>  for <m> i = 1,2, \ldots, n</m>. Then the set has size
<m> s_1 + s_2 + \cdots + + s_n \leq kn</m> . This contradicts size 
at least <m> kn+1</m>. So some <m> s_i \geq k+1</m> . <m> \Box</m> 
  </p>
</proof>

<proof>
  <title>Proof of Pigeonhole Principle Contrapositive </title>
  
  <p>
    Let  <m> s_i</m>  denote the size of the <m> i^{th}</m>  part. 
     With each <m> s_i \leq k</m>  we have
set size <m> s_1 + s_2 + \cdots + + s_n \leq k+ k + \cdots + k \leq kn</m>.  <m> \Box</m> 
  </p>
</proof>



<p> The intuition from the examples above shows that we can prove a 
  statement directly or via the contrapositive.
We will first illustrate and then formally define the contrapositive.
</p>

<p> Here, informally, we have the original statement as 

  <men xml:id="pigh-direct">   \text{set size at least  } kn+1  \Rightarrow  \text{some  }  
  s_i \text{  has size at least  }  k+1   </men>

  Negating <q> some <m> s_i</m>  has size at least <m> k+1</m> </q> 
  we get <q> all <m> s_i</m>  have size at most <m> k</m> </q>. Negating
  <q> set size at least <m> kn+1</m> </q> we get <q> set 
    size at most <m> kn</m> </q>. 
    
  </p> 
  
  <p> The contrapositive  is then
  <men xml:id="pigh-cont"> 
    \text{all  }  s_i   \text{  have size at most  }  k
    \Rightarrow  \text{  set size at most  }  kn 
  </men>

 Could <xref ref="pigh-direct" /> be true and <xref  ref="pigh-cont" /> 
 be false?
</p> 

<p>
  For <xref  ref="pigh-cont" /> false, there just needs to 
  be a single specific counterexample with all part sizes at most <m>k</m>
  and set size at least <m>kn+1 </m>. Then 
   <xref ref="pigh-direct" />  applies and we conclude that
   some part size is at least <m>k+1</m>, which is a contradiction.
   Similarly we cannot have
    false <xref  ref="pigh-cont" /> and <xref ref="pigh-direct" /> true. 

</p>

  <definition xml:id="def-contrapositive">
 
  <statement> <p>
For a statement of the form <m> P</m>  implies <m> Q</m> ,
 the <term> contrapositve </term> is <em> Not  <m> P</m> </em> 
 implies <em> Not   <m> Q</m> </em>. 
  </p> </statement> 
  </definition> 

  <fact xml:id="fact-contrapositive-equiv">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A statement <m> P</m>  implies <m> Q</m>  and it's contrapositive
         <em> Not <m> P</m>  </em> implies <em> Not <m> Q</m> </em>
         are logically equivalent. Either both are true or both are false. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </fact>

  <p>
    While a proof using the contrapositive can always be translated 
    into a proof by contradiction, there are proofs by contradiction 
    that do not have a naturally stated contrapositve version as they 
    are not in the form <m> P</m>  implies <m> Q</m>. One such example is
    a proof that there are infinitely many primes in 
    <xref ref="section-pigeonhole-infprimes" />
