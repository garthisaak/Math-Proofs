  <title>Infinite Sequence example</title>

  <p>We next move toward infinite sequences and a place where the Erdos-Szekeres Theorem can be used as a Lemma in a proof of a result in this setting. </p>

<p>There are other proofs that use different approaches. </p>

<p>We will be considering infinite sequences and will allow repeated values. It is not difficult to see that the Erdos-Skekeres Theorem still holds if we allow repeated values and replace increasing and decreasing with nondecreasing (i.e., weakly decreasing, ties allowed) and nonincreasing (i.e., weakly increasing, ties allowed). </p>

<p>To avoid extra details we will also leave some terms defined informally. These should be examined carefully and precisely in the right setting. We just do not have space here. </p>

<p>The goal will be to outline a proof of the following. As indicated in the name, the full result holds in more general settings.  </p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-bolzano">
  <title>Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem (for real numbers in one dimension)</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Every bounded infinite sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.  
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<p>
  Rather than formally defining convergent, we give an informal (and old) example. The formal definition is interesting in its own right but requires quite a bit of extra work and is left for elsewhere. 
</p>

<example xml:id="expl-zeno">
  <statement>
    <p> We present a slight variant of an old paradox to the ancient Greeks. With modern mathematical definitions and terminology it isn't really a paradox anymore. </p>
	
    <p> The fast runner Atalanta must first complete half of her race, then half of the remaining half, then half the remaining quarter then <m>\ldots </m>. </p>  
    
    <p> This can repeat infinitely. The distance she runs is <me> (1/2) + (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^3 + \cdots
    = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^k </me> </p>
    
    <p>This should be 1 but how can an infinite sum be finite? </p>
    
    <p>Students who have taken calculus already are familiar with the ideas of how we now handle this. A quick review follows. </p>
    
    <p>The sum above is a <term> geometric series </term>, the ratio of one term to the next is a fixed value <m>r</m> , in this case <m>r = 1/2</m> .  </p>
    
    <p> To consider the infinite sum we look at  partial sums   <me>S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^k
    = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n</me>. 
    Using  <xref ref="prop-geop"/>,
    we have <m>1 + S_n = \frac{(1/2)^{n+1} - 1}{1 - 1/2}</m>
    from which <m>S_n = 1 - (1/2)^n</m>.
  </p>
    
    <p> Informally <m>1 - (1/2)^n</m>  converges to <m>1</m>  since <m>(1/2)^n</m>  is arbitrarily small for large <m>n</m>. That is the sequence of partial sums converges to <m>1</m>  because the sequence <m>(1/2),(1/2)^2, (1/2)^3, (1/2)^4, \ldots</m>  converges to 0. </p>
  </statement> 
</example>

    <p> As noted before, a formal definition of convergence is important and should be studied, but we will skip it here.
    In general, an infinite sequence (even if it doesn't have the nice pattern of this example) converges to some number <m>c</m>  if terms get arbitrarily close to <m>c</m>  (and stay close) for large <m>n</m>  (indices on the terms).
    </p>

<p>
  To get to the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem we will put together several results.
	The first we state without formal definitions and omit its proof.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-monotonec">
  <title>{Monotone Convergence Theorem  (for real numbers in one dimension)</title>
  <statement>
    <p> Every nondecreasing infinite sequence of real numbers that is bounded above converges to its least upper bound. </p>
		
		<p> Every nonincreasing infinite sequence of real numbers that is bounded below converges to its greatest lower bound. </p> 
  </statement>
</theorem>

<p> The following follows from the <xref ref="thm-erdosszc">Erdos-Szekeres Theorem </xref>.
To see this: If, for some finite <m>p,q</m>, the longest nondecreasing subsequence has length <m>p</m>  and the longest nonincreasing subsequence has length <m>q</m> , then by the (contrapositive version) of the Erdos-Szekeres Theorem the sequence length is at most <m>pq</m>, contradicting the fact that it is infinite. 
</p> 

<corollary xml:id="cor-erdossz">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Every infnite sequence of real numbers has either a nondecreasing infinite subsequence or a
      nonincreaing infinite subsequence.  
    </p>
  </statement>
</corollary>

<p>
  Now the proof of the <xref ref="thm-bolzano"> Bolzanao-Weierstrass Theorem </xref> follows from applying the 
  <xref ref="thm-monotonec"> Monotone Convergence Theorem </xref>   and the <xref ref="cor-erdossz"> 
    Corollary of the Erdos-Szerkeres Theorem </xref>.
