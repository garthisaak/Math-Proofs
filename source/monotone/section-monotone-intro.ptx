      <p>
        Consider the following list of 17 distinct integers:
	
        <me> {\bf 8},12,6,3,1,{\bf 9},5,4,15,13,2,11,10,7,17,{\bf 16},14. </me>
        
        The boldface numbers 8,9,16 form an <term> increasing subsequence </term>, a list in
        the same order as the entire list whose entries are increasing. A
        longer increasing subsequence is 3,5,11,16 indicated in bold
        <me> 8,12,6,{\bf 3},1,9,{\bf 5},4,15,13,2,{\bf 11},10,7,17,{\bf 16},14. </me> 
        Many other increasing subsequences of size 4 can easily be found.
      </p>
        
      <p> We could check that there is no increasing subsequence of length 5.
      </p>

      <p> 
      We can also check that there is a decreasing subsequence of length 5.
        There are two of them: 8,6,5,4,2
      and 15,13,11,10,7 but none of length 6.
      </p>

      <exploration xml:id="es-example" >
        <p> Informally, the pigeonhole principle shows that if <q> enough </q> 
        pigeons are placed into a fixed number of boxes, we 
        can force some box with a <q> large </q> number of pigeons.  
        </p>
        
        <p> Is there a similar result for subsequences?  </p> 
        
        <p> That is, if a sequence is <q> long enough </q>  is it forced to 
          have a long increasing subsequence?  </p> 

          <solution>
            <p>
              No, for example the sequence 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 has no increasing 
              subsequence of length 2.  
        This can obviously be extended to any length sequence. 
        Similarly an increasing sequence of any length has no decreasing subsequence of length 2. 
            </p>
          </solution>
        
        <p>
        
        However, a long sequence is guaranteed to have either a 
        long increasing subsequence or a long decreasing subsequence. 
        
        The general area called <xref ref="sec-induction-ramsey" > Ramsey Theory </xref>  can be viewed as extending 
        the pigeonhole principle to showing that in the right circumstances, 
        certain <q> patterns </q> are guaranteed to exist in <q> large enough </q> 
        objects.

  Before we can proceed to prove the results discussed above we need
  some formal notation to describe what we are talking about.

  The Erdos-Szekeres Theorem (1935) will establish the results discussed 
  in <xref ref="es-example"/>. 
The proof that we give here is due to Hammersley (1972). The original 1935
proof of Erdos and Szekeres is a bit more complicated.
To see the trick that we will use for a simple proof of the
Erdos-Szekeres theorem we start by recording what little
information we can easily gather about monotone subsequence sizes.
 </p>

 <exploration xml:id="expl-es">
  <p>
    Consider
    <me>  s_1,s_2, \ldots, s_{10} = 10,4,8,6,7,5,2,9,1,3. </me>
    For each term, <m>s_i</m>, let  <m>x_i</m>  denote the size of a longest
    increasing subsequence ending in that term. In particular the subsequence must include that last term.
    (So this is not the length of a longest increasing subsequence up to 
    that term. It is the longest increasing subsequence up to that term and including it.) 
  </p> 
    
    <p>  The only subsequence ending in <m>s_1= 10</m> 
    is 10, so <m>x_1 = 1</m>. The are two subsequences ending in 4; 
    <m>s_1,s_2 =
    10,4</m>  and <m>s_2 = 4</m>. Only the second is increasing, 
    so <m>x_2 = 1</m>.
    The subsequences ending in <m>s_3 =8</m>  are 10,4,8 and 10,8 and 
    4,8 and 8.
    The longest increasing one is 4,8 and thus <m>x_3 = 2</m>. Similarly
    <m>x_4 = 2</m>  etc. 

    </p> 

    <p> 
    
    We can do the same thing for decreasing subsequences ending 
    in <m>s_i</m>  and write <m>y_i</m>  for these. 
    Writing these sizes beneath the list we have 
    
    <me> 
      \begin{array}{r|rrrrrrrrrr}
      i  &amp; 1  &amp; 2  &amp; 3  &amp; 4  &amp; 5  &amp; 6  &amp; 7  &amp; 8  &amp; 9  &amp; 10 \\  
      s_i  &amp;	10  &amp; 4  &amp; 8  &amp; 6  &amp; 7  &amp; 5  &amp; 2  &amp; 9  &amp; 1  &amp; 3  \\  \hline
      x_i  &amp;	1   &amp; 1  &amp; 2  &amp; 2  &amp; 3  &amp; 2  &amp; 1  &amp; 4  &amp; 1  &amp; 2 \\
       y_i  &amp;  1  &amp; 2  &amp; 2  &amp; 3  &amp;  3  &amp; 4  &amp; 5  &amp; 2  &amp; 6  &amp; 5 \end{array} </me> 
    
    In this particular example these values tell us that the longest increasing subsequence length is 4
    and the longest decreasing subsequence length is 6.

    </p> 

    <p> 
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consider the sublists of terms with the same <m>x_i</m> value, 
      for example those with <m>x_i = 1</m> or those with <m>x_i = 1</m>. 
      Each of these is increasing. In general must sublists of terms with equal 
      <m>x_i</m> value be increasing? Justify your answer by either
      providing and example where the sublist is <em>not </em> increasing or
      a proof that such sublists must be increasing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Looking at the pairs <m>(x_i,y_i)</m> we see that they are 
      disitinct. In general is it possible to see the same 
      <m>(x_i,y_i)</m> more than once? Justify your answer by either providing
      an example where the same pair does appear twice or a proof that this is impossible.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
</p> 

    <solution>
   
      <p>
Note that 
for <m>i \lt j</m>  if <m>s_i \lt s_j</m>  then <m>x_j \gt x_i</m>  because any increasing
subsequence ending in <m>s_i</m>  can be extended to a longer increasing subsequence ending
in <m>s_j</m>  by adding <m>s_j</m>  at the end.  
Similarly <m>i \lt j</m>  if <m>s_i \gt s_j</m>  then <m>y_j \gt y_i</m>  because any decreasing
subsequence ending in <m>s_i</m>  can be extended to a longer decreasing subsequence ending
in <m>s_j</m>  by adding <m>s_j</m>  at the end. 
      </p>


    <p> 
        Thus, since the <m>s_i</m>  are distinct, either <m>x_j \gt x_i</m>  or <m>y_j \gt y_i</m>  for <m>i \lt j</m>. 
        In particular, the order pairs <m>(x_i,y_i)</m>  are distinct. To illustrate,
        if, for example we saw

    </p>
     <p>  
         
<me>
  \begin{array}{lrrrrrrrrrr}
    s_i  &amp; s_1  &amp; s_2  &amp; s_3  &amp; s_4  &amp; s_5  &amp; s_6  &amp; s_7  &amp; s_8  &amp; s_9  &amp; s_{10} \\ \hline
    x_i  &amp;  *   &amp; *  &amp; *  &amp; 4  &amp; *  &amp;  *  &amp; 4  &amp; *  &amp; *  &amp; *  \\
    y_i  &amp;  *  &amp; *  &amp; *  &amp; 2  &amp;  *  &amp; *  &amp; 2  &amp; *  &amp; *  &amp; *   \end{array}
  </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        then
        since <m>x_4 = x_7= 4</m>  we must have <m>s_4 \gt s_7</m>  and since
        <m>y_4 = y_7 = 2</m>  we must have <m>s_4 \lt s_7</m>. 
        This is impossible. So the pairs are distinct. 
      </p>

    </solution>
  </exploration>  

      <p>
        In <xref ref="es-example"/>
      If the largest value of <m>x_i</m>  is 3 and the largest value of
      <m>y_i</m>  is 3 then  there are at most <m>3 \cdot 3 = 9</m>  
      possible pairs
      <m>(x_i,y_i)</m>.  Since they must be distinct there are at most 9 terms.
      This is an application of 
      the contrapositive of the pigeonhole principle. 
      </p>

    <p> 

      These ideas show that any list of 10 distinct numbers contains either an increasing subsequence with size at
      least 4 or a decreasing subsequence with size at least 4. For the specific example
      above we see that the maximum length of an increasing subsequence is 4
      and there is a partition into 4 decreasing sublists. Similarly, the maximum length
      of a decreasing sublist is 6 and there is a partition into 6 increasing sublists.
        
      </p>
   
 
<p>
  We take the ideas of the previous example
for the following proof. We will repeat the discussion above about distinct pairs in the proof  for completeness.  
We will defer discussion of <q> best possible </q> to later.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-erdossz">
 <title>Erdos-Szekeres Theorem</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Any list of <m>pq+1</m>  distinct numbers contains either
      an increasing subsequence of size <m>p+1</m>  or a decreasing subsequence of size <m>q+1</m>. 
    </p> <p> This is best possible:
      there are lists of <m>pq</m>  distinct numbers with no increasing subsequence of size <m>p+1</m>  and no
      decreasing subsequence of size <m>q+1</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
<p>
  For each term, <m>s_i</m>, let  <m>x_i</m>  denote the size of a longest increasing
subsequence ending in (and including) that term and let <m>y_i</m>  denote the size of a longest
decreasing subsequence ending in (and including) that term. If the longest increasing subsequence has size
at most <m>p</m>  the and the longest decreasing subsequence has size at most <m>q</m>  then
<m>x_i \leq p</m>  and <m>y_i \leq q</m>  for <m>i = 1,2, \ldots, pq+1</m> . Since there are <m>pq</m>  possible
pairs <m>(x_i,y_i)</m>, by the pigeonhole principle,  <m>(x_i,y_i) = (x_j,y_j)</m>  for some <m>i \lt j</m>.
Since <m>x_i = x_j</m>  then <m>s_i \gt s_j</m>  since if <m>s_i \lt s_j</m> 
any increasing subsequence ending in <m>s_i</m>  could be extended to a longer increasing
subsequence ending in <m>s_j</m>. Similarly, <m>y_i = y_j</m>  implies <m>s_i \lt s_j</m> . This is a contradiction.
So either some <m>x_i \geq p+1</m>  or some <m>y_i \geq q+1</m>. That is, either there is an increasing subsequence of length at least <m>p+1</m>  or a decreasing subsequence of length at least <m>q+1</m>. <m>\Box</m> 
</p>

</proof>

<p>
  While the Erdos-Szekeres Theorem is not usually stated in the contrapaotive, it is useful
  for illustrating the contrapositive to do so.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-erdosszc">
  <title>Erdos-Szekeres Theorem - Contrapositive form</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      If a list of distinct numbers has longest increasing subsequence size <m>p</m>  and longest increasing
	subsequence size <m>q</m>  then the list has at most <m>pq</m>  terms.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<p>
  The Erdos-Szekeres Theorem guarantees that a sequence of <m>16 = 3 \cdot 5 + 1</m>  distinct numbers contains either an increasing subsequence of length <m>3+1 = 4</m>  or a decreasing subsequence of length <m>5+ 1 = 6</m> .
</p>

<p>
  To show that the bound is best possible we need to exhibit a specific sequence of length 15 in which neither of these occur.  We give the following example a name <m>S_{3,5}</m>  to indicate that it shows the bound is best possible when <m>p=3</m>  and <m>q=5</m>. 
  We also shift indices to start at 0 rather than 1 as it ends up being more covenient notation in a general proof. 
	<me>  S_{3,5} = s_0,s_1, \ldots, s_{14} = 5,4,3,2,1,10,9,8,7,6,15,14,13,12,11 </me>
	Observe that this partitions into 3 decreasing subsequences 
<m>D_0 = s_0,s_1, \ldots s_4 = 5,4,3,2,1</m>  and <m>D_1 = s_5,s_6, \ldots, s_9 = 10,9,8,7,6</m> 
and <m>D_2 = s_{10},s_{11}, \ldots, s_{14} = 15,14,13,12,11</m>.
Any increasing subsequence can use at most 1 term from each of the <m>D_i</m>  and hence has length at most 3.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, this partitions into  5 increasing subsequences 
  <m>I_0  = s_0,s_5,s_{10} = 5,10,15</m>  and <m>I_1 = s_1,s_6,s_{11} = 4,9,14</m>  and 
  <m>I_2  = s_2,s_7,s_{12} = 3,8,13</m>  and <m>I_4 = s_3,s_8,s_{13} = 4,9,12</m>  and
  <m>I_5 = s_4,s_9,s_{14} = 1,6,11</m>. 
  
  Any decreasing subsequence can use at most 1 term from each of the <m>I_i</m>  hence can have length at most 5. 
</p>

<p>
  Other examples would be 
<me> S_{7,10} = s_0,s_1, \ldots, s_{69} = 10,9,8,\ldots, 3,2,1, 20,19, \ldots, 11, \ldots, 70,69, 68, 
\ldots, 63,62,61 </me>
with no increasing subsequence of length 8 and no decreasing subsequence of length 11 and
<me> S_{5,3} = s_0,s_1, \ldots, s_{14} = 3,2,1,6,5,4,9,8,7,12,11,10,15,14,13 </me>
with no increasing subsequence of length 6 and no decreasing subsequence of length 4. 
</p>

<p>
  In general, to show that the Erdos-Szekeres bound is best possible for all <m>p,q</m>  we could define  the sequence <m>S_{p,q} = s_0,s_1, \ldots, s_{pq-1}</m> 
by <m>s_i = q(a+1)-b</m>  where <m>a</m>  is the quotient and <m>b</m>  the remainder when <m>q</m> 
divides <m>i</m>. By the <term> division algorithm </term> <m>a,b</m>  are the unique integers <m>a \geq 0</m>  and
<m>0 \leq b \leq q-1</m>  such that <m>i = qa + b</m> . Showing that <m>D_0,D_1, \ldots, D_{p-1}</m>  (with <m>s_i</m>  in <m>D_j</m>  if the quotient when <m>i</m>  is divided by <m>q</m>  is <m>j</m> ) is a partition into decreasing subsequences and
that <m>I_0,I_1, \ldots, I_{q-1}</m>  (with <m>s_i</m>  in <m>I_j</m>  if the remainder when <m>i</m>  is divided by <m>q</m>  is <m>j</m> ) 
	is a partition into increasing subsequences shows that the bound is best possible. The details are left as an exercise.
