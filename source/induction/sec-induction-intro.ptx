  <p>
    The <term> principle of mathematical induction </term>  is an important proof method in 
    most areas of mathematics. Before foramlly defining it we will illustrate
    with a simple example with two proofs using the same idea but different
    terminology. 
  </p>

  <p> 
 Formal defintions of these terms will come later. For now, simply aim to
 follow the various proofs of </p> 

 <fact xml:id="fact-3div4n-1">
  <statement>
    <p>
      For  <m>n = 0,1,2, \ldots</m>, 3 divides <m>4^n - 1</m>.
      That is <m>\frac{4^n - 1}{3}</m> is an integer.
    </p>
  </statement>
 </fact>

 

 <proof><title>Minimal counterexample proof of <xref ref="fact-3div4n-1"/> </title>

  <p>
    Assume that there is some integer for which the result does not hold.
    Let <m>k</m> be the smallest value for which <m>\frac{4^k - 1}{3}</m> is 
    <em>not </em> an integer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>\frac{4^0 - 1}{3} = 0</m> is an integer, <m>k</m> is not 0. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>k</m> is smallest, <m>\frac{4^{k-1} - 1}{3}</m> is an integer.
      Then 
      <me>
        \frac{4^k - 1}{3} = \frac{4(4^{k-1} - 1) + 3}{3} 
        = 4 \, \frac{4^{k-1} - 1}{3} + 1
      </me>
      is an integer since <m>4, \frac{4^{n-1}-1}{3}</m>  and 1 are all integers. 
      This contradicts the assumption that <m>\frac{4^k - 1}{3}</m> is 
      <em>not </em> an integer. So there is no such <m>k</m> and the conclusion holds for all
      <m>n = 0,1,2, \ldots</m>. <m>\Box</m>
      
    </p>
 </proof>

 <proof><title>Induction proof of <xref ref="fact-3div4n-1"/> </title>


    <p>
      Since <m>\frac{4^0 - 1}{3} = 0</m> is an integer the claim holds for <m>n=0</m>. 
    </p>
    <p> For <m>n \geq 1</m>, by induction, we may assume that 
       <m>\frac{4^{n-1} - 1}{3}</m> is an integer.
      Then 
      <me>
        \frac{4^n - 1}{3} = \frac{4(4^{n-1} - 1) + 3}{3} 
        = 4 \, \frac{4^{n-1} - 1}{3} + 1
      </me>
      is an integer since <m>4, \frac{4^{n-1}-1}{3}</m>  and 1 are all integers. 
      Thus, by induction  the claim holds for all
      <m>n = 0,1,2, \ldots</m>. <m>\Box</m>
      
    </p>
 </proof>

 <p>
  In the induction proof the first sentence, establishing the claim directly 
  when <m>n=0</m> is called the <term>basis</term>. In general the basis will cover
  all initial  values for which the general argument does not work. </p>
  <p> In the second setence
  the assumption that the claim holds for <m>\frac{4^{n-1}-1}{3}</m> is called the
  <term>induction hypothesis</term>. In general the induction hypothesis allows us to 
    assume that the claim holds for all values less than <m>n</m>.
 </p>

 <p>
  Our purpose here was to start to illustrate induction. We can also
  give a short proof of <xref ref="fact-3div4n-1"/> using partial sums
  of geometric series as noted in <xref ref="rmk-geop"/>.
 </p>

 <p>
  We consider a toy problem called  Golomb's Tromino Theorem. 
  Consider tiling a <m>4 \times 4</m> chessboard with <m>L</m>-shaped
   <q>trominos</q>, 3 squares in the shape of an <m>L</m>.

<p> 
Clearly we can't tile the entire board since each tromino has 3 tiles, so the total number of squares covered
must be a multiple of 3. However, we can cover 15 of the 16 squares. 
<xref ref="golomb1"/> shows two different tilings, each  missing one square. </p> 

<p> Can we choose any square to miss? It is not hard to see, for example, by rotating the upper right tromino, that
we can miss any of the 4 upper right squares. 
Then by rotating or flipping the entire board we can miss any preselected 
square. </p> 

<p> In general we can ask what kind of tilings are possible. Here, 
  to illustrate induction, we will
aim to tile <m>2^n \times 2^n</m> boards, missing any one preselected square.  There is at least a chance that this is possible
since we know from <xref ref="fact-3div4n-1"/>  that 3 divides <m>4^n-1</m>. Alternatively, our proof  that we can complete such tilings,
 which will not explicitly use the divisibility, will imply this division result as a corollary. </p>

<p> By rotating the large board, we may assume that the square missing a 
tile is in the upper right quadrant. </p> 

<p> Consider trying to tile an <m> 8 \times 8</m>  board with  the 
  missing the square in the top row, second from the right. Assuming that 
  we have already established tilings for <m>4 \times n</m> boards, we can 
  make an appropriate choice of four of these start to build a tilin gof the larger board.
  Then, by adding one more tromino we can complete the tiling of the larger board.
</p>
  
  <p> We  inductively
  use the board on the right in <xref ref="golomb1"/> and place this
   in the upper right <m> 4 \times 4 </m> subboard. 
   We then almost fill the remaining three
  <m>4 \times 4</m> subboards; lower left, lower right and upper left. Each will leave a missing square. 
  For the induction to work we need to line up the missing squares so that they can be covered by one more tromino.
  So we  put the missing squares for these <q>in the middle </q> of
   the large board. Each of these is a rotation of the board on the left in
   <xref ref="golomb1"/>. Then we complete the tilin gof te large board by
   adding one more tromino to cover the missing squares <q>in the center</q>.
  </p> 
  
  <p> We illustrate this below:

<p>
  We inductively used our smaller boards, each missing one square, placed so that 
one square  is in the right location for the  missing one in the larger square and the other 3 abut and form an
<m>L</m> that can be covered by one more tromino to complete the larger tiling. It should be
clear that we can continue this process to tile, for any <m>n</m>, 
<m>2^n \times 2^n</m> boards with any specified missing rectangle. </p>

<p> 
We will not write out the details. However this illustrates essence of 
proofs by induction.  We show a basis, in this case it would be the trivial
observation that we can tile <m>2 \times 2</m> boards with any missing square
using a single tromino. Then we can build to any size by using smaller 
boards, that we have already built, which we call the induction hypothesis. 
The description of how we do this building is called the induction step. 
</p>

<subsection>

 <p>  We have already seen an example of a proof by induction and a proof by
  minimal counterexample. We describe these more formally now. It may still be best 
  to not spend too much time of the formal definitions and instead jump to further examples that follow. 
 </p> 

  <fact xml:id="fact-wellorder">
  <title>Well ordering principle</title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a smallest element.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </fact>

<p> This seem obvious and we will take it as such. Whether it is 
  considered an axiom or something proved from more basic axioms depends 
  on details of which system of arithmetic is being used. </p> 

<p> Despite its simplicity it is the basis a a fundamental proof technique. 
It is the principle underlying proofs by minimal counterexample. In these, we assume that the claimed result is false and consider 
a smallest counterexample. Then using the fact that for smaller examples 
the claim is valid, we reach a contradiction and then conclude that the 
claim is true.
</p> 

<p> The well Ordering Principle can be shown to be equivalent to the 
  Principle of Mathematical Induction, which we will state here. 
   We will skip a proof of the 
equivalence of well ordering and induction.
</p> 

<fact xml:id="fact-pinduction">
  <title>Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider a statement <m>P(n)</m> depending on integer <m>n</m>.  
      If for some <m>k</m>
        <ul>
          <li> <m>P(0), P(1), \ldots P(k)</m> are true (that is the statement is true for <m>k</m> initial values) </li>
          
          
          
          <li> For <m>n \gt k</m> truth is <m>P(0),P(1), \ldots, P(n-1)</m> implies the truth of <m>P(n)</m> </li> 
          
        </ul>
      
      Then <m>P(n)</m> is true for all integers <m>n = 0,1,2, \ldots</m>
    </p>
  </statement>
</fact>
	
	
<p> 
Technically what we just stated is called strong induction. Ordinary induction only assumes
a basis of <m>P(0)</m> being true and also only assumes the truth of <m>P(n-1)</m> in the second part. However these are equivalent. 
</p>

<remark>
  <p> For induction we can shift the <q>starting point</q> </p>
	
	<p> That is, if the statement is only true for values of <m>n</m> greater than some fixed <m>t</m>, we can start 
	with some initial values <m>P(t), P(t+1), \ldots, P(t+k)</m> and show that for <m>n \gt t+k</m> the truth
	of <m>P((k), \ldots P(n-1)</m> implies the truth of <m>P(n)</m>
	we get that the statement holds for all integers <m>k,k+1, \ldots</m>. </p>
</remark>

<remark>
  <p>
    The idea of mathematical induction is a common and extremely useful
tool in mathematical proofs. As noted,  it is essentially equivalent to proofs
based on the well ordering principle, 
where we assume that there is a counterexample and by looking at one
of minimum size reach a contradiction, showing that there is no
counterexample. In addition, induction is closely related to recursive 
algorithms. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Learning mathematical induction may be a bit like learning to ride a
bike. It seems almost impossible at first and you fall and scrape
your knees a few times but eventually you get it and it turns out
that it isn't hard and you can really do a lot once you figure it
out.
  </p>
</remark>

<example xml:id="expl-recurrence1">
  <p>Consider the recurrence <m>B_n =
    B_{n-1} + 6B_{n-2}</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m>  with initial conditions <m>B_0 = 1</m> and <m>B_1 = 8</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This recurrence gives the sequence <m>1,8,14,62,146,518, \ldots</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The
general formula is <m>B_n = 2 \cdot 3^n + (-1) (-2)^n</m>. 
 </p>

 <p>
  We will soon prove that the general formula is correct. 
 </p> 

<p>  If we have the formula, even without explanation or justification of how it was obtained, we can prove its correctness
using induction. 
</p>

<p> There are standard methods to discover these formulas. One approach, given without details:  Note that if a solution 
is for the form <m>x^n</m> for <m>x \not = 0</m>, then we have <m>x^n = x^{n-1} + 6x^{n-2} \Rightarrow x^2 - x - 6 = 0</m>.
A linear combination of the roots <m>-2,3</m> of this quadratic provides 
the solution with the multipliers <m>2</m> and <m>-1</m> chosen so that 
the initial conditions hold. </p>

<p> If the initial conditions change then the multipliers <m>2</m> and <m>-1</m> would change but the terms <m>3^n</m> and <m>(-2)^n</m> would 
remain. </p>

<p> Other recurrences of this form, linear, homogeneous with constant 
  coefficients have solutions in a similar way related to initial 
  conditions and roots of the corresponding characteristic polynomial. 
  This holds and produces real solutions even if the roots are complex. 
  The solution is a bit more complicated if there are repeated roots. 
  We will leave that for elsewhere. </p>

</example>

<p> We restate the formula from <xref ref="expl-recurrence1"/> and then 
give two proofs, with induction and minimal counterexamples for illustration.
The proofs are somewhat more wordy and detailed than necessary since these
are early examples. </p> 

<fact xml:id="fact-recurrence1">

<proof><title>Minimal counterexample proof of <xref ref="fact-recurrence1"/>
   </title>
  <p>
    We prove that the formula is correct by contradiction.
Assume that the formula is false. Then there is some smallest non-negative
integer <m>n</m> for which it is false: the formula fails for <m>n</m> but holds for all smaller values.
That is, we assume that <m>B_n \not = 2 \cdot 3^n + (-1) (-2)^n</m>
but that <m>B_{n-1} = 2 \cdot 3^{n-2} + (-1) (-2)^{n-2}</m>,
<m>B_{n-2} = 2 \cdot 3^{n-3} + (-1) (-2)^{n-3}, \ldots, B_0 = 2 \cdot
3^{0} + (-1) (-2)^{0}</m>.  </p> <p> Note first that substituting <m>n = 0</m> and
<m>n=1</m> into the formula we get <m>B_0 = 2 \cdot 3^0 + (-1)(-2)^0 = 1</m>
and <m>B_1 = 2 \cdot 3^1 + (-1) (-2)^1 = 8</m>. So the formula works for
<m>n = 0, 1</m>. Thus <m>n \geq 2</m> and we can apply the recursion to <m>B_n</m>.
Using the recursion and the assumptions of the correctness of
the formulas for <m>B_{n-1}</m> and <m>B_{n-2}</m> and some basic algebra 
we get

<men xml:id ="eq-recurrence1"> 
  \begin{array}{rcl}
	B_n &amp; = &amp; B_{n-1} + 6 B_{n-2} \\
	&amp; = &amp; \left[ 2 \cdot 3^{n-1} + (-1) (-2)^{n-1} \right] +
	6 \left[ 2 \cdot 3^{n-2} + (-1) (-2)^{n-2} \right] \\
	&amp; = &amp; 2 \left(3 + 6 \right) 3^{n-2} + (-1) \left( -2 +
	6\right)(-2)^{n-2} \\
	&amp; = &amp; 2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 3^{n-2} + (-1) \cdot (-2)^2 \cdot
	(-2)^{n-2} \\
	&amp; = &amp; 2 \cdot 3^n + (-1)(-2)^n
\end{array} 
</men>

Thus the formula holds for <m>n</m>, contradicting the assumption that
<m>n</m> is the smallest number for which the formula fails. So there
can be no such number: the formula holds for all <m>n = 0,1,2,
\ldots</m>. <m>\Box</m>
  </p>
</proof>

<p>
  The key to the proof was showing that if the formula is
correct for <m>B_{n-2}</m> and <m>B_{n-1}</m> then it is correct for <m>B_n</m>.
These are the equations <xref ref="eq-recurrence1"/> in the proof of 
<xref ref="fact-recurrence1"/>. Those computations
work for any choice of <m>n \geq 2</m>. So we could use them along with the easily
checked fact that the formula is correct for <m>B_0</m> and <m>B_1</m> to
show that it is correct for <m>B_2</m>. Then since it is correct for
<m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m> we use the computations above to see that the
formula is correct for <m>B_3</m>. Continuing this way we see that
we can build up to showing that the formula is correct for any
<m>B_n</m>.

We display this as follows:
</p>

    <cell>Formula holds for <m>B_0</m> and <m>B_1</m></cell>

    <cell> <m>\vdots </m> </cell>
    <cell><m> \vdots </m> </cell>

</tabular>

<p> It is apparent that this shows that this shows that the formula
works for all <m>n = 0,1,2, \ldots</m>.

</p>

<p>
  The terminology of mathematical induction is what succinctly captures
  this process.

  We prove that the formula is correct using mathematical
  induction. Since <m>B_0 =
  2 \cdot 3^0 + (-1)(-2)^0 = 1</m> and <m>B_1 = 2 \cdot 3^1 + (-1) (-2)^1 =
  8</m> the formula holds for <m>n = 0</m> and <m>n=1</m>. For <m>n \geq 2</m>, by
  induction </p> 
 <me> \begin{array}{rcl}
  B_n &amp; = &amp; B_{n-1} + 6 B_{n-2} \\
  &amp; = &amp; \left[ 2 \cdot 3^{n-1} + (-1) (-2)^{n-1} \right] +
  6 \left[ 2 \cdot 3^{n-2} + (-1) (-2)^{n-2} \right] \\
  &amp; = &amp; 2 \left(3 + 6 \right) 3^{n-2} + (-1) \left( -2 +
  6\right)(-2)^{n-2} \\
  &amp; = &amp; 2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 3^{n-2} + (-1) \cdot (-2)^2 \cdot
  (-2)^{n-2} \\
  &amp; = &amp; 2 \cdot 3^n + (-1)(-2)^n
  \end{array}
 </me>
 <p>  Hence the formula holds for all <m>n = 0,1, \ldots</m>. <m>\Box</m>
</p>

</proof> 

<remark>
  <p>The words <q>by induction</q> or sometime <q>by the induction 
    hypothesis</q> 
 are shorthand for the idea described above that we have
already proved the statement for smaller values of <m>n</m> and are
presenting the method to get to the next value and that this can
be repeated to show the statement for all <m>n</m>. </p>

<p> Checking the initial values, those for which the generic argument does not apply, <m>n =0</m> and <m>n=1</m> in the example
above is called the basis of the induction. </p> 
</remark>

<p> Recall that the Fibonacci numbers satisfy the recurrence
<m>F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}</m> for <m>n \geq 2</m> with
<m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_1 = 1</m>. This is similar to <xref ref="fact-recurrence1"/>
 but with different coefficients. 
A similar induction proof can be used to show that
<m>F_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n</m>.
Doing the algebra by hand seems more complicated due to the square roots, 
but it is essentially the same as that in the proofs of <xref ref="fact-recurrence1"/>. 
</p> 

<p> Our next example to practice induction is an identity involving the 
  Fibonacci numbers. </p>

  <example>
    <p>
      We first illustrate how one might <q> discover </q> <xref ref="fact-finid1"/>.
      Consider the first few Fibonacci numbers <me>
        0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, \ldots 
      </me>
      and look at sums of intial terms. For example, the sum of the first six terms is
      <m>0+1+1+2+3+5 = 12</m>. Computing these we get the following sequence of partial sums
      <me>
        0,1,2,4,7,12,20,33,54,88, \ldots
      </me>
      The sums appear to be one less than another Fobonacci number. We can prove this by induction.
    </p>
  </example>

  <p> The next example is a detailed description to illustrate the induction process.
  readers already beginning to feel comfortable with induction might skip this and
  proceed directly to the relatively compact induction proofs of <xref ref="fact-fibid1"/>.
  </p> 

  <example>
   <p>  To again illustrate the ideas behind a mathematical induction proof
we describe the process in detail. The final proof will hide all of
this and be very short. </p> 

<p> Substituting <m>n = 0</m> into the equation we get <m>1 + F_0 = F_2</m>. Since
<m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_2 = 1</m> this is <m>1 + 0 = 1</m> and clearly true. When
<m>n=1</m> we get <m>1 + F_0 + F_1 = F_3</m>. With <m>F_0 = 0. F_1 = 1</m> and <m>F_3
= 2</m> we have <m>1 + 0 + 1 = 2</m> and the statement is true. Using the
recurrence for Fibonacci numbers we have <m>F_3 = F_2 + F_1</m> and
substituting <m>F_2 = 1 + F_0</m> which we have just established we get
<m>F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = (1 + F_0) + F_1</m> as needed. </p> 

<p> For <m>n = 2</m> we need to establish <m>F_4 = 1 + F_0 + F_1 + F_2</m>. Using
the Fibonacci recurrence and <m>F_3 = 1 + F_0 + F_1</m> which we have
just shown to be true we get <m>F_4 = F_3 + F_2 = (1 + F_0 + F_1) +
F_2</m> and the identity holds for <m>n = 2</m>. </p> 

<p> Now imagine that we keep doing this and have shown the identity for
<m>n = 0,1,2, \ldots, 11</m> and we want to show it for <m>n = 12</m>. That
is, we already know the following:
<me> \begin{array}{rcl}
	F_2 &amp; = &amp; 1 + F_0 \\
	F_3 &amp; = &amp; 1 + F_0 + F_1 \\
	F_4 &amp; = &amp; 1 + F_0 + F_1 + F_2 \\
	\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
	F_{13} &amp; = &amp; 1 + F_0 + F_1 + \cdots + F_{11} \end{array} </me> </p> 

<p> We want to know show that <m>F_{14} = 1 + F_0 + F_1 + \cdots + F_{11}
+ F_{12}</m>. Substituting the last line above (which we have already
established to be true) and the recurrence we get
<me> F_{14} = F_{13} + F_{12} = (1 + F_0 + F_1 + \cdots + F_{11}) +
F_{12} = 1 + F_0 + F_1 + \cdots + F_{12} </me>. </p> 

<p> So using the fact that the identity is known to be true for <m>n =
0,1, \ldots, 11</m> we have shown that it is true for <m>n = 12</m>. In fact
we really only needed the fact that the identity is known to be true
for <m>n = 11</m>. That it is true for <m>n=0,1, \ldots, 10</m> is in this
case extra unused information. (In some induction proofs we will
need the truth of the statement for all smaller values.) </p> 

<p> There was nothing to special about <m>n=11</m> so just use the symbol
<m>n</m>. That is, we imagine that we have shown the identity true for
<m>1,2, \ldots, (n-1)</m> and we want to show that it is true for <m>n</m>. So
we assume that we already know the following:
<me> \begin{array}{rcl}
	F_2 &amp; = &amp; 1 + F_0 \\
	F_3 &amp; = &amp; 1 + F_0 + F_1 \\
	F_4 &amp; = &amp; 1 + F_0 + F_1 + F_2 \\
	\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
	F_{(n-1)+2} &amp; = &amp; 1 + F_0 + F_1 + \cdots + F_{n-1} \end{array} </me> We
want to use these fact and anything else we know (in this case the
Fibonacci recurrence) to show the identity for <m>n</m>. That is we need
to show <m>F_{n+2} = 1 + F_0 + F_1 + \cdots + F_n</m> using the
assumptions above. </p> 

<p> We can do this fairly easily by substituting the last line of the
values assumed to be true, where the left side is <m>F_{(n-1)+2} =
F_{n+1}</m> and the recurrence to get
<me> F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_{n} = (1 + F_0 + \cdots + F_{n-1}) + F_n
= 1 + F_0 + \cdots + F_{n-1} + F_n. </me> Observe that the second
equality is simply using the associative property. We didn't really
need to do this but include it to make sure things are clear. </p> 

<p> So we have shown that the identity holds at <m>n</m> when it is assumed
to be true for <m>1,2, \ldots, n-1</m>. This we can imagine a process of
building up values for which we know it is true, <m>n=0</m> then <m>n=1</m>
then <m>n=2</m> then <m>\cdots</m> then <m>n=11</m> then <m>n=12</m> <m>\cdots</m>. Clearly
we can do this to get all numbers <m>0,1,2, \ldots </m> and this
established that the identity is true for all <m>n</m>. </p> 

<p> This is mathematical induction. The wording of a proof using
mathematical induction is a way of describing the process we went
through above without writing so much. If we all understand that
this is what is meant by induction then we can present the proof
ideas very succinctly. </p> 
  </example>

  <example xml:id="expl-poisonp">
    <p>
      What is called a Poisson Process is often a good model for waiting times. For example 
arrivals of customers to a shop or web site. </p> 

<p> If customers arrive, on average, at a rate of <m>\lambda</m> per time unit 
then the waiting time for the <m>n^{th}</m> arrival is modeled by the Gamma distribution 
(actually by a special case of the Gamma distribution sometimes called 
the Erlang distribution after Erlang who studied this in the context of 
phone calls to an operator center in the early 1900s). </p>

<p> In particular, the probability that the <m>n^{th}</m> arrival occurs by time <m>t</m> is
<m>\int_0^t  \frac{\lambda e^{-\lambda x}(\lambda x)^{n-1}}{\Gamma (n)} \, dx</m>  

where we define the Gamma function <m>\Gamma(n)</m> by
 <m>\Gamma(n) = \int_0^{\infty}  e^{- x} x^{n-1} \, dx</m>.  </p> 
 
 <p> When <m>n</m> is a nonnegative integer <m>\Gamma(n) = (n-1)! = (n-1)(n-2) \cdots (2)(1)</m>.

  </example>

  <p>
    We will show the result about the Gamma function mentioned above by induction.
To simplify notation we shift the <m>(n-1)</m> and <m>(n-1)!</m> that appear above to <m>n</m> and <m>n!</m>.

<fact xml:id="fact-gamma"> <title>

</fact> 

<p> By convention we use <m>0! =1</m>.This simplifies notation. </p> 

<proof> 
  <p> 
By induction. For the basis, when <m>n=0</m> it is an easy exercise to check that  
<m>\int_0^{\infty} e^{-x}x^{0} \, dx = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-x} \, dx = 1 = 0!</m>. </p> 
	
<p> We assume the induction hypothesis, that <m>\int_0^{\infty} e^{-x}x^{n-1} \, dx = (n-1)!</m> 
and use it to prove <m>\int_0^{\infty} e^{-x}x^{n} \, dx = n!</m>.  Then by induction the result holds for all <m>n</m>. 
</p> 

<p> To show this use integration by parts with

<m>u = x^n</m>, <m>du = nx^{n-1} \, dx</m> and 
<m>dv = e^{-x} \, dx</m>, <m>v = -e^{-x}</m>. 

Then

<me> \begin{array}{rcll} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-x}x^{n} \, dx  &amp; = &amp; \left[ -e^{-x} x^n \right]^{\infty}_0

<subsection> <title>Inequalities </title>

  <p> 
We further illustrate induction by giving induction proofs of two important inequalities:
The <xref ref="thm-agme">arithmetic-geometric mean inequalty </xref>
and the <xref ref="thm-cauchy-schwarz">Cauchy-Schwarz inequality </xref>
  </p> 

  <remark>
    <p>
      The induction proofs of the inequalities contain 
a slightly more complicated induction step than our previous examples. 
In particular we will see this in the proof of the normalized arithmetic-geometric mean inequality
and will see it in later examples where we use induction.
    </p>

    <p>
      In previous examples for each <m>n</m> there was a single statement 
to be shown, for example <m>\frac{4^n-1}{3}</m> is an integer,
or <m>1 + r + r^2 + \cdots + r^n = \frac{r^{n+1}-1}{r-1}</m> etc. 
For the arithmetic geometric mean inequality we are proving a 
statement of the form <q> all sets of integers that satisfy a certain 
property (the hypothesis) satisfy a second property (the conclusion). </q>
    </p>

    <p> So when we do the <q> reduction</q>  from size <m>n</m> to smaller sizes we need to careful to do two things
      <ul>
      <li> We must be sure that the `reduction' applies to all 
      size <m>n</m> object that satisfy the hypothesis. </li>
      
      <li> We must be sure that the new size <m>n-1</m> example also satisfy the hypothesis in order that induction can be applied. </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
  </remark>

  <definition xml:id="def-amean">
    <title>Arithmetic Mean</title>  
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term> arithmetic mean </term>  of a set <m>y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n</m> of
  numbers is <m>\frac{y_1 + y_2 + \cdots + y_n}{n}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  
  <p> This is the usual
  notion of <q> average</q>.
  Another notion of <q>average</q> is the following: </p> 
  
  <definition xml:id="def-gmean">
    <title>Geometric Mean</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term> geometric
mean </term>  (which works for nonnegative numbers) is <m>(y_1y_2 \cdots
y_n)^{1/n}</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  
  
 <p>  That is, for the geometric mean we take the <m>n^{th}</m> root of the product of
  the <m>n</m> numbers. </p>  
  
  <p>  One typical application of the geometric mean is in
  averaging inflation rates or finding the <q>average</q> rate of return in
  an investment. </p> 

  <example xml:id="expl-gmean">
  <p>   Say that you invest $100. During the first year your
return is 10%, 
ending the year with 110. During the second year
you lose 7% and during the third year you lose 3%. What is your
average rate of return?
  </p> 
  <p>  Using the arithmetic mean the average of of
10%, -7% and -3% is 0. You should break even at the end of three
years. </p>
<p>  However, doing the calculations the amount, in dollars, after the first year is
<m>100 \cdot (1.1) = 110</m>, after the second year
<m>110 \cdot (.93) = 102.3</m> and after the third year
<m>102.3 \cdot (.97) = 99.231</m>. This is <em> not </em> 
breaking even, so the arithmetic mean does work to correctly
compute avergae rate of return. </p>

<p>
 In this situation you multiply your principle by
<m>(1.1)(.93)(.97)</m>. 
The geometric mean of these three numbers is
<m>\sqrt[3]{(1.1)(.93)(.97)} = \sqrt[3]{.99231} \approx .99743 = 1 -
.00257</m>. The situation above would be the same as losing .257% each
year. The geometric mean gives the correct interpretation for
<q>average</q> in situation where you get a total by multiplying.
</p> 
  </example>

<p>
  In <xref ref="expl-gmean"/> we saw that the geometric mean gives the correct <q> average </q>
  rate of return for an investment. If you incorrectly use the arithmetic mean,
  how does your computation compare to the correct value? In the example
  the arithmetic mean was an overestimate. This will always be the case.

          If

    <p>
      It is natural to try to find a smaller instance by simply omitting one of the <m>y_i</m> and thus, 
      for example, 
      consider  <m>y_1,y_2, \ldots, y_{n-1}</m>. This approach fails 
      because the product <m>y_1y_2 \cdots y_{n-1}</m> will no longer be 1 unless
      <m>y_n=1</m>. So we would not be able to apply the induction hypothesis to the smaller list.
    </p> 
    <p>  For example, if our numbers are 
      <m>\frac{7}{4},\frac{3}{2},\frac{2}{3}, \frac{4}{7}</m> then a new 
      list <m>\frac{7}{4},\frac{3}{2},\frac{2}{3}</m> does not have the 
      correct product. Instead, a trick that works is to take the product 
      of 2 numbers as one new new number.  For example we could try 
      smaller lists <m>\frac{7}{4},\frac{3}{2}, \frac{8}{21}</m> or 
      <m>\frac{7}{4},1, \frac{6}{7}</m>. These both are smaller and 
      have the right product so we can apply the induction hypothesis 
      to the smaller list to conclude
      that their sum is at least 3 (since the smaller list has <m>n=3</m>). 
    </p> 
    <p> 
        While we could combine any pair in this way, it will turn out that 
        we will need to be a little more careful with the selection in order
        to use the induction hypothesis, the new list sum is at least <m>n-1</m>, 
        to show that the original list has sum at least <m>n</m>.
       numbers sum to at least 4 will not work. What will work is to 
      combine the largest number and the smallest number, so that one of 
      them is at least 1 and one is at most 1. For example, combining the 
      largest and smallest in our example, the new list to use is  
      <m>1,\frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{3}</m>. 
    </p>
    
    <proof>
      <title> Proof of normalized AG mean inequality</title>
      
       <p> The proof is by induction. The inequality is trivial when <m>n=1</m>
    since then <m>x_1 = 1</m> and clearly  <m>x_1 \geq 1 = n</m>. 
    </p> 
    
    <p> For <m>n \geq 2</m> relabel the numbers
    so that <m>x_1 \geq x_{2} \geq \cdots \geq x_n</m>. Note that since
    <m>x_1x_2 \cdots x_n = 1</m> we have <m>x_1 \geq 1 \geq x_n</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Consider the
    <m>(n-1)</m> numbers <m>x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_1x_n</m>. Note that
    <m>x_2 + \cdots + x_{n-1} + x_1x_n</m> satisfy <m>x_2x_3 \cdots x_{n-1}(x_1x_n)
    = x_1x_2 \cdots x_n = 1</m>. So by induction
    these numbers satisfy the inequality and sum to at most <m>(n-1)</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>  Then
    <me> \begin{array}{rl}  &amp; x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n  \\
       = &amp;
      (x_2 + \cdots + x_{n-1} + x_1x_n ) + [x_1 + x_n - x_1x_n] \\
       \geq &amp; (n-1) + \left[ 1 + (x_1 - 1) - x_n(x_1 - 1) \right] \\
       = &amp; n + (x_1 - 1)(1 - x_n) \\
       \geq &amp; n \end{array}
    </me> 
    Here the last inequality follows from <m>(x_1 - 1)(1 - x_n) \geq 0</m>
    since <m>x_1 \geq 1 \geq x_n</m>. 
  This inequality is strict unless 
    <m>x_1 =1</m> or <m>x_n=1</m>. However, since  <m>x_1x_2 \cdots x_n = 1</m>
    and we assumed <m>x_1 \geq x_{2} \geq \cdots \geq x_n</m>
    if either <m>x_1 =1</m> or <m>x_n=1</m> then all <m>x_i =1</m>.
     <m>\Box</m>
    </p>
</proof>

<p>
  Our second induction proof of the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean inequality 
  uses a trick that goes back to Cauchy. We first illustrate with some examples.
</p>

<example>
  <p>
    When <m>n=2</m>, which will become the basis for our induction, we need to show that <m>x_1 + x_2 \geq 2\sqrt{x_1x_2}</m>. 
For scratch work we square both sides to get <m>x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2  \geq 4x_1x_2</m>. Rearranging this becomes <m>x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 \geq 0</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>  Of course our proof should not start by assuming  <m>x_1 + x_2 \geq 2\sqrt{x_1x_2}</m>. Instead we need to reverse the steps and show that this
     follows from the basic fact that <m>(x_1 - x_2)^2 \geq 0</m>. We need to use the fact that the <m>x_i</m> are nonnegative for one of the reverse steps to hold. 
     We will write this out in the correct direction in the written proof
     <xref ref="pr-agcauchyl"/> that follows.  </p> 
    <p> 
Consider next <m>n=4</m>. From the <m>n=2</m> case applied twice we have <m>(x_1 + x_2) + (x_3 + x_4)
\geq 2\sqrt{x_1x_2} + 2\sqrt{x_3x_4}</m>. Then applying the <m>n=2</m> 
case again with the numbers
<m>2\sqrt{x_1x_2}</m> and  <m>2\sqrt{x_3x_4}</m> we get 
<me>  2\sqrt{x_1x_2} + 2\sqrt{x_3x_4} \geq 2\left(\sqrt{ 2\sqrt{x_1x_2} \cdot 2\sqrt{x_3x_4} }\right) = 4 \sqrt[4]{x_1x_2x_3x_4}</me>.  Hence
we get the <m>n=4</m> case <m>x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \geq 4(x_1x_2x_3x_4)^{1/4}</m>. 
</p>
<p> For the <m>n=8</m> case, splitting into two parts of size 4, applying the <m>n=4</m> case to each of these and then the <m>n=2</m> case to the resulting 2 numbers shows the formula for <m>n=8</m>. Repeating will yield and induction proof of 
  the inequality for all powers of <m>2</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A final additional step will then be to use the result for powers of 2 to prove it
    in general.
  </p>
</example>

<lemma xml:id="lem-agcauchyl">
  <title>Cauchy's AG mean inequality for powers of 2</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      For <m>n = 2^k</m> non-negative numbers <m>x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>
<me> x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \geq n(x_1x_2 \cdots x_n)^{1/n}  
 </me> 
with equality only if <m>x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</lemma>

<p>In the following we are proving a result powers of 2, <m>n = 2^k</m>. So our induction
parameter will be <m>k</m> rather than <m>n</m>. Notice also that for the basis we need
to consider both <m>k=0</m> and <m>k=1</m> as the induction step will not work
to show the <m>2 = 2^1</m> case from the <m>1 = 2^0</m> case. 
</p> 

<proof xml:id="pr-agcauchyl">
  
  <p>
    The proof is by induction on <m>k</m>. The basis is the cases <m>k=0</m> and <m>k=1</m>. For <m>k=0</m>, so <m>n=1</m> the statement is simply <m>x_1 \geq x_1</m> which holds trivially.
  </p> 
  <p> 
For <m>k=1</m>, so <m>n=2</m> we have
<m>x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 \geq 0</m> which implies <m>x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2 = (x_1 + x_2)^2  \geq 4x_1x_2</m>.
Since the <m>x_i</m> are nonnegative we can take roots and get
 <m>x_1 + x_2 \geq 2\sqrt{x_1x_2}</m>. Note that equality holds throughout only if <m>x_1 = x_2</m>. 
  </p>
  <p> For <m>n = 2^k</m> with <m>k \geq 2</m> let <m>Y_1 =  x_1 + \cdots + x_{n/2}</m> and 
  <m>Y_2 = x_{n/2+1} + \cdots + x_{n}</m>. Then by induction
    <me> \begin{array}{rl} &amp; 
      \left( x_1 + \cdots + x_{n/2} \right) + \left( x_{n/2+1} + \cdots + x_{n} \right) \\
    &amp; = Y_1 + Y_2 \\
     &amp; \geq 2\left(Y_1Y_2\right)^{1/2} \\
      &amp; \geq 2 \left( \frac{n}{2}(x_1 \cdots x_{n/2})^{2/n} \cdot \frac{n}{2}(x_{n/2+1} \cdots x_{n})^{2/n}
      \right)^{1/2} \\
   &amp; = n(x_1x_2 \cdots x_n)^{1/n}
   \end{array} 
    </me> 
  The inequalities follow by induction, from the <m>n=2</m> case for the first inequality and two applications
  of the <m>n/2</m> case for the second inequality. 
  </p> 
  
  <p> To get equality throughout we need <m>Y_1 = Y_2</m> and the <m>x_i</m>'s in <m>Y_1</m> equal as well as the <m>x_i</m>s in <m>Y_2</m> all equal. Hence we need all <m>x_i</m> equal. <m>\Box</m> 
  
  </p>
</proof>

<p>
  Now to cover the cases where <m>n</m> is not a power of 2 we use <term> backward induction </term>. 
  We assume the result holds for larger values and use these as the induction
  hypothesis to  show it for smaller values. 
</p>

<p> We illustrate the idea with an example first. </p> 

<example>
  <p> To illustrate the trick used here we do a small example, with <m>n = 3</m>. For <m>x_1 = 3, x_2 = 4, x_3 =8</m> we have arithmetic mean <m>5 = (3 + 4 + 8)/3</m> and geometric mean <m>4.58 \approx \sqrt[3]{96} = \sqrt[3]{3 \cdot 4 \cdot 8}</m>. 
We can assume by <xref ref="lem-agcauchyl"/> that the inequality holds for <m>n= 4</m>, a power of 2. We need to construct a new instance with 4 numbers, apply the inequality and use this to show the inequality for the 3 given numbers. The trick is to add a new number equal to the arithmetic mean of the given numbers. In this case 5. 
  </p> 
  <p> 
By <xref ref="lem-agcauchyl"/> we know that <m>\frac{3 + 4 + 8 + 5}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{3 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 \cdot 5}</m> 
 and want to show that
<m>\frac{3 + 5 + 8}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{3 \cdot 4 \cdot 8}</m>. 
  </p> 
  <p>
Adding the arithmetic mean to a set of numbers does not change the mean. So the left side in both inequalities is 5.
Assuming this we get <m>5 \geq \sqrt[4]{3 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 \cdot 5} \Rightarrow 5^{3/4} \geq (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 8)^{1/4}</m> and by raising to the <m>4^{th}</m> power we get <m>\frac{3 + 5 + 8}{3} = 5 \geq \sqrt[3]{3 \cdot 4 \cdot 8}</m>.

     <m>y_i = x_i</m> for <m>i = 1,2, \ldots, n</m> and <m>y_{n+1} = a</m> we get
     <m> \frac{x_1 + \cdots + x_n + a}{n+1} \geq \left( x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n a \right)^{1/n+1}</m>.
     Using <m>x_1 + \cdots + x_n = na</m> this becomes <m>a \geq \left( x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n a \right)^{1/n+1}
     \Rightarrow a^{n+1} \geq x_1x_2 \cdots x_n \cdot a \Rightarrow a^n \geq x_1x_2 \cdots x_n</m>.
     Since the numbers are nonnegative taking the <m>n^{th}</m> root preserves the inequality and we get
     <m>\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \left( x_1x_2 \cdots x_n
     \right)^{1/n}</m>.

     We get equality only if <m>a = y_i</m> for all <m>i</m> which is only if all <m>x_i</m> are the same. <m>\Box</m>

    <p> The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality shows up in various forms in many areas of mathematics.
    It also holds in a more general setting called inner product spaces. We state the version
    for real numbers here.

    <p>
      
      The result hold trivially when <m>n=1</m>. However for the basis we also need to
      directly check the <m>n=2</m> case. That is, our induction step 
      will only work starting at <m>n=3</m>. While it is also 
      straightforward to check the <m>n=2</m> case we will assume it here in order to focus on
