  <title>Quadratic Formula Derivation</title>

  <p> The examples above suggest that we should look into a more 
    general setting. Indeed, the roots for question \ref{q2} would typically be found using the familiar quadratic formula. 
    Our aim here is to get to that. That is answer the following </p>

    <alert>
        <p>
            What are the roots of <m> ax^2 +bx +c </m>. That is, solutions to
            <m> ax^2 +bx +c =0 </m>?
        </p>
    </alert>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Here we are using symbols <m> a,b,c </m>  to represent a 
                generic but fixed constant and <m>x </m>  to represent the 
                variable. 
                This follows a standard convention so we don't specify 
                this in the statement.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                There is an additional implicit assumption here that 
                <m> a \not = 0</m>. Otherwise it would be linear, not quadratic. </p>

            <p> In our derivation of the quadratic formula we will 
                divide by <m> a </m>  so this assumption is necessary. 
                For the quadratic formula we sometimes do not explicitly 
                state this assumption because it add clutter and is `clear' from context. 
                In other settings, explicitly stating any assumptions or restrictions will 
                be important.
                
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Why <m> a,b,c </m> and <m> x </m> ?  We could have written 
                <m> \Delta z^2 + \Gamma z + \Psi = 0 </m> 
                or <m>xa^2 + ya + z = 0</m> . These would give the same solution, just with symbols switched around.
                It has become convention. in English, that usually 
                (but not always) we use small Latin letters near the start of 
                the alphabet for constants and small Latin letters near the 
                end of the alphabet for variables. </p>
                
                <p> As we move to more complicated situations it 
                    will be important to understand what each symbol 
                    represents and if there are any constraints on it.

        We mentioned that in the quadratic formula there is an 
        assumption that <m>a \not = 0</m>. For an example of why we 
        need to be careful with these extra assumptions consider the 
        following <em> false statement </em>

        <me>
         \mbox{if  } ax \lt ay \mbox{  then  }  x \lt y 
        </me>
    
        Obviously this statement is false. 
        If <m>a = -5</m> and <m>x = 3</m> and <m>y = 2</m>  
        we would be asserting that since <m> -15 \lt -10</m> then 
        <m>3 \lt 2</m> 
        because <m>(-5) \cdot 3 = 15 \lt -10 = (-5) \cdot 2</m>
        so the statement would then imply 
        <m>3 \lt 2</m>, which is nonsense.
     </p>

     <p>
        We can say the following, which is correct
<me>  \mbox{For  } a \gt 0, \mbox{if  } ax \lt ay \mbox{  then  }  x \lt y </me>
     </p>
