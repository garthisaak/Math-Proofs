        What are the roots of <m> x^2 - x - 2</m>? 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
              Answer 1; The roots are <m>-1</m> and <m>2</m> as 
              can easily be checked: <m>(-1)^2 - (-1) - 2 = 0</m> and 
              <m>2^2 - 2 - 2 = 0</m>.
            </li>
          
            <li> Answer 2: Since <m>x^2 - x - 2 = (x+1)(x-2)</m> the roots are  
              <m>-1</m> and <m>2</m>.

    <p>
      Are we happy with either of the two <q> proofs </q> in
      <xref ref="example-roots1"/>?  </p> 

      <p> <ul>
 
        <li> <p> Since we are solving a very specific problem rather than a 
          more generic result, like the quadratic formula, it is better to 
          call the explanations above <q> solutions </q>, <q> examples </q> 
          or <q> answers </q> rather 
          than <q> proofs </q>. </p>  </li>
          
          <li> <p> The question assumes that we know what a root is. 
            In this context we mean the roots of the polynomial 
            <m>f(x) = x^2 - x - 2</m>
            and by roots we mean <m> x</m> such that <m>f(x) = 0</m>. 
            That is, solutions to <m>x^2 - x - 2 = 0</m>. </p> </li>
            
            <li>  <p> Why the word root? You can look up the history. 
              It relates to square root, e.q <m>x^2 = 16</m> or 
              <m>x^2 = 27.953</m> etc.
            We usually use integers in examples rather than arbitrary 
            numbers like 27.953, indeed we could even use irrational numbers
            but it's usually not particularly useful for examples read by humans. 
            and meant to illustrate  a basic concept. Unless explicitly noted, even if 
            examples for illustration are integers, we need to consider more 
            general cases of real numbers or potentially even complex 
            numbers. </p>  </li>
            
            <li> <p> The quadratic formula describes all roots.  We could ask 
              for <q>a </q> root but it is incorrect to say <q> the </q> 
              root since there is  more than one.
            For example, it doesn't make sense to ask <q> who is the student who 
            gets an A in class?</q>   Hopefully there is more than student who gets
            an A, so 
            asking for <q>the</q> A student is not correct as <q> 
            the </q>
          implies that there is only 1 such student.  </p> 
            </li> 
    </ul>
  </p> 

  </remark>

 
    <p> The two answers both make an assumption that we have 
      found 
      all of the roots. We have found 2 roots, but maybe there 
      could be 
      3 or 4 or infinitely many. The second proof at least has some 
      indication that there are only two roots as it essentially 
      uses the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
    Knowledge from precalculus, calculus also could show that a quadratic polynomial cannot have more than 2 
    roots.  </p>
    
    <p> The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial 
      of degree <m>n</m>, has, counting multiplicity, 
      exactly <m>n</m> roots in the complex numbers. 
      That is, can be written as <m>a(x-r_1)(x-r_2) \ldots (x-r_n)</m> 
      where <m>r_1,r_2, \ldots, r_n</m> are the roots. In particular a 
      degree 2 polynomial has 2 roots. </p>  


    <p>
      Another assumption hidden in answer 2 of <xref ref="example-roots1"/> is  that if the product of two 
      numbers is zero then one or both is 0.
      We can take this for granted in this situation but in other contexts 
      we need to be careful. This will not be the case in modular 
      arithmetic, sometimes informally called called clock arithmetic. 
      If the only numbers are hours on the clock, <m> 0,1,2, \ldots, 11</m> 
      (with <m>0</m> being  the same as <m>12</m>) then <m>3 </m> times 
      <m>4 </m> is <m> 0 </m> , 
      since three sets of four hours returns to the same spot. Formally we 
      will write <m>3 \cdot 4 \equiv 0 \pmod {12}</m> and say that <m>3 </m> 
      times <m>4</m> is 
      congruent to <m>0 </m> modulo <m>12 </m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This impacts the solutions to quadratic congruences. For example, working modulo 
      <m> 12 </m>, <m> -1 </m> is the same as <m> 11 </m> and the congruence
      <m> x^2 - x - 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{12} </m> has solutions <m> 2 </m> and
      <m> -1 \equiv 11 \pmod{12} </m> parallel to the two solutions, 
      <m> 2 </m> and <m> -1 </m> found for <m> x^2 - x - 2 = 0 </m> with
      real numbers in <xref ref="example-roots1" />. However 
      <m> x^2 - x - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{12} </m> has no solutions modulo 12 
        since <m> x^2 - x - 1</m> is always odd and hence cannot be a 
        multiple of 12 while  in the real numbers <m> x^2 - x - 1 = 0 </m> has two
        as in  <xref ref="example-roots2" />. 
    </p>
    
    <p> Also, 
        <m> x^2 - x - 6 \equiv 0 \pmod{12} </m> has four solutions,
        <m> 3, 6, 7, 10 </m>. Since <m> x^2 - x - 6 = (x-3)(x+2) </m>, 
        we have real solutions 3 and -2 and correspondingly, modulo 12 we have solutions
        3 and <m> -2 \equiv 10 \pmod{12}</m>. However, as <m>3 \cdot 8 \equiv 0 \pmod {12}</m>
        we also get the solution 6 by setting <m> x-3 \equiv 3 </m> and 
        <m>x+2 \equiv 8</m> and as <m>4 \cdot 9 \equiv 0 \pmod {12}</m>
        we also get the solution 7 by setting <m> x-3 \equiv 4 </m> and 
        <m>x+2 \equiv 9</m>.
    </p>


  <p> If we change <xref ref="example-roots1" /> slightly, things appear more complicated. 
  However the <q> complication </q> is because we, as humans, find it harder to 
  multiply <m> \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} </m> 
   in our heads or by hand than
  to multiply <m> (-1) \cdot 2 </m>. Conceptually, both problems and 
  proofs are essentially the same. </p> 

  <example xml:id="example-roots2">
    <statement>
      <p>
        What are the roots of <m> x^2 - x - 1</m>? 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Answer 1: The roots are <m>\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}</m> and 
            <m>\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}</m> as can easily be checked: 
            <me>\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1
           = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5}+ 5}{4} - \frac{2 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 1 = 0</me> 
           and 
            <me> \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1
           = \frac{1 - 2\sqrt{5}+ 5}{4} - \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 1 = 0 </me>. 
            </li>

            <li> Answer 2: <me> x^2 - x - 1  =    \left(x - \frac{1 + 
              \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)\left(x - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)</me>
               since
            since expanding the right side we see that coefficient of <m> x </m> 
            is <m> - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} -
            \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 </m> and the constant term is 
            <m>\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = 
            \frac{1^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2}{2^2} = \frac{1-5}{4} = -1 </m>. 
            So the roots are <m>\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}</m> and 
            <m>\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}</m>.
            </li>
        </ul>
       
      </p>
    </solution>
    
  </example>

  <p>
    While we don't have a formal definition of <q> unsatisfying </q> in 
    mathematics, <xref ref="example-roots2" /> is. We did some messy 
    but elmentary arithmetic to check our answers.  However,  there is no 
    motivation of how the roots were found. Such a <q> proof </q> or
     <q>example</q> is 
    not useful as it does not guide us to solving or understanding similar 
    problems. Technically it isn't incorrect but really we would hope for 
    more explanation. While such straightforward computations are necessary 
    to verify correctness, 
    they may be best left to the privacy of your own home.

  <remark>
    <p>
      One might notice a certain similarity between <m> x^2 - x - 1 = 0 </m> 
      and the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers
      <m>F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}</m> with <m>F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1</m>. 
      If a solution has the form that <m> F_n </m> is a power <m> x^n </m> 
      then <m> x^n = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} \Rightarrow x^2 - x - 1 = 0 </m> 
      (assuming <m>x \not = 0 </m>). So the roots satisfy the recurrence 
      and an appropriate 
      linear combination <xref ref="definition-linearcombination"> 
        linear combination </xref> to get the initial conditions 
      <m> F_0 = 0 </m>  and  <m> F_1 = 1 </m> 
      yields the Binet formula for Fibonacci numbers
      <m> F_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n - 
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n </m> . Yes, this is an integer. 
      Since the second term converges quickly to 0, the <m> n^{th}</m> 
       Fibonacci  number is the first term rounded to the nearest integer.
